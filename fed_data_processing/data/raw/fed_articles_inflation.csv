Implications of structural changes in the U.S. economy for pricing behavior and inflation dynamics,"Willis, Jonathan L.",N/A,5-27,https://www.kansascityfed.org/documents/1659/Implications_of_Structural_Changes_in_the_U.S._Economy_for_Pricing_Behavior_and_Inflat.pdf,fedker:31251,"Some key features of the behavior of inflation in the United States appear to have changed in the past 20 years, with potentially important implications for forecasters and policymakers. Recent studies have provided evidence of a decline in both the variability and persistence of inflation. ; Such shifts in the behavior or dynamics of inflation would necessitate changes in the economic relationships used by policymakers and economists to assess current conditions, forecast key economic indicators, and determine the implications of policy changes for future economic activity. ; Willis examines how structural changes in the economy over the past two decades may have affected the price-setting behavior of firms and, in turn, the behavior of aggregate inflation. He concludes that structural changes in the economy over the past 20 years have likely contributed to a decrease in the persistence and volatility of inflation."

Monetary policy regime switches and macroeconomic dynamic,"Foerster, Andrew T.",N/A,N/A,https://www.kansascityfed.org/documents/7707/rwp13-04.pdf,fedkrw:40974:original,"This paper investigates how different monetary policy regime switching types impact macroeconomic dynamics. Policy switches that either affect the inflation target or the response to inflation deviations from target lead to different determinacy regions and different output, inflation, and interest rate distributions. With regime switching, the standard Taylor Principle breaks down in multiple ways; satisfying the Principle period-by-period is neither necessary nor sufficient for determinacy. Switching inflation targets primarily affects the economy's level, whereas switching inflation responses affects the variance. Even in periods with a fixed monetary policy rule, expectations of future policy switches produce different outcomes depending upon the switching type. Monetary authorities with given inflation objectives need to adjust their policy parameters to counteract expectations of future policy switches."

Signaling effects of monetary policy,"Melosi, Leonardo",N/A,N/A,http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2012/wp2012_05.pdf,fedhwp:6385:original,"We develop a DSGE model in which the policy rate signals the central bank's view about macroeconomic developments to incompletely informed price setters. The model is estimated with likelihood methods on a U.S. data set including the Survey of Professional Forecasters as a measure of price setters' expectations. The signaling effects of monetary policy are found to be empirically important and dampen the effects of monetary disturbances on inflation. While the signaling effects enhance the Federal Reserve's ability to stabilize the economy in the face of demand shocks, they play a small role in stabilizing the economy after technology shocks."
Pandemic-Era Inflation Drivers and Global Spillovers,"Silva, Alvaro, Kalemli-Özcan, Ṣebnem, Yildirim, Muhammed A., di Giovanni, Julian",N/A,58,https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr1080.pdf,fednsr:97350,"We estimate a multi-country, multi-sector New Keynesian model to quantify the drivers of domestic inflation during 2020–23 in several countries, including the United States. The model matches observed inflation together with sector-level prices and wages. We further measure the relative importance of different types of shocks on inflation across countries over time. The key mechanism, the international transmission of demand, supply and energy shocks through global linkages helps us to match the behavior of the USD/EUR exchange rate. The quantification exercise yields four key findings. First, negative supply shocks to factors of production, labor and intermediate inputs, initially sparked inflation in 2020-21. Global supply chains and complementarities in production played an amplification role in this initial phase. Second, positive aggregate demand shocks, due to stimulative policies, widened demand-supply imbalances, amplifying inflation further during 2021-22. Third, the reallocation of consumption between goods and service sectors, a relative sector-level demand shock, played a role in transmitting these imbalances across countries through the global trade and production network. Fourth, global energy shocks have differential impacts on the U.S. relative to other countries’ inflation rates. Further, complementarities between energy and other inputs to production play a particularly important role in the quantitative impact of these shocks on inflation."

"House prices, credit growth, and excess volatility: implications for monetary and macroprudential policy","Lansing, Kevin J., Mendicino, Caterina, Gelain, Paolo",N/A,N/A,http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2012/wp12-11bk.pdf,fedfwp:8561:original,"Progress on the question of whether policymakers should respond directly to financial variables requires a realistic economic model that captures the links between asset prices, credit expansion, and real economic activity. Standard DSGE models with fully-rational expectations have difficulty producing large swings in house prices and household debt that resemble the patterns observed in many developed countries over the past decade. We introduce excess volatility into an otherwise standard DSGE model by allowing a fraction of households to depart from fully-rational expectations. Specifically, we show that the introduction of simple moving-average forecast rules for a subset of households can significantly magnify the volatility and persistence of house prices and household debt relative to otherwise similar model with fully-rational expectations. We evaluate various policy actions that might be used to dampen the resulting excess volatility, including a direct response to house price growth or credit growth in the central bank?s interest rate rule, the imposition of more restrictive loan-to-value ratios, and the use of a modified collateral constraint that takes into account the borrower?s loan-to-income ratio. Of these, we find that a loan-to-income constraint is the most effective tool for dampening overall excess volatility in the model economy. We find that while an interest-rate response to house price growth or credit growth can stabilize some economic variables, it can significantly magnify the volatility of others, particularly inflation."
Self-confirming Price Dispersion in Monetary Economies,"Baughman, Garth, Rabinovich, Stanislav",N/A,37 pages,https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018046pap.pdf,fedgfe:35253:original,"In a monetary economy, we show that price dispersion arises as an equilibrium outcome without the need for costly simultaneous search or any heterogeneity in preferences, production costs, or search technologies. A distribution of money holdings among buyers makes sellers indifferent across a set of posted prices, leading to a non-degenerate price distribution. This price distribution, in turn, makes buyers indifferent across a range of money balances, rationalizing the non-degenerate distribution of money holdings. We completely characterize the distribution of posted prices and money holdings in any equilibrium. Equilibria with price dispersion admit higher maximum prices than observed in any single-price equilibrium. Also, price dispersion reduces welfare by creating mismatch between posted prices and money balances. Inflation exacerbates this welfare loss by shifting the distribution towards higher prices."

Another attempt to quantify the benefits of reducing inflation,"Braun, R.

Other researchers have suggested that reducing inflation would have fairly large benefits?from 1 to 3 percent of gross domestic product. But that result depends on the unrealistic assumption that the government would replace inflation with a lump-sum tax, one which does not affect people's incentives. If, instead, inflation is replaced with an increase in the labor income tax, then the welfare gains that can be expected from reducing inflation below its current level are much smaller?from one-third to one-half of 1 percent of gross domestic product."
"Identification and estimation of a model of hyperinflation with a continuum of \""sunspot\"" equilibrium","Wallace, Neil, Sargent, Thomas J.",N/A,N/A,http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/common/pub_detail.cfm?pb_autonum_id=551,fedmwp:42456:original,"This paper constructs a model with two structural equations: the Government budget constraint and a linear version of Cagan?s portfolio balance equation. The model contains a continuum of equilibria with ?sunspot equilibria.? Closed forms for the solutions are found. Even though there is a continuum of equilibria, the model is overidentified econometrically, so that the model restricts time series data on price levels and currency stocks. We describe how the free parameters of the model can be estimated, including some parameters that serve to index particular members of the continuum of equilibria. The sunspot equilibria hold out some promise of explaining anomalies in the observed behavior of inflation and real balances during hyperinflations."
Inflation persistence,"Fuhrer, Jeffrey C.",N/A,N/A,http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp2009/wp0914.htm,fedbwp:7197:original,"This paper examines the concept of inflation persistence in macroeconomic theory. It begins with a definition of persistence, emphasizing the difference between reduced-form and structural persistence. It then examines a number of empirical measures of reduced-form persistence, considering the possibility that persistence may have changed over time. The paper then examines the theoretical sources of persistence, distinguishing ?intrinsic? from ?inherited? persistence, and deriving a number of analytical results on persistence. It summarizes the implications for persistence from the literatures on ?sticky-information? models, learning models, and so-called ?trend inflation models,? providing some new results throughout."
Can Supply Shocks Be Inflationary with a Flat Phillips Curve?,"L’Huillier, Jean-Paul, Phelan, Gregory",N/A,68,https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-202336,fedcwq:97528:original,"Not in standard models. With conventional pricing frictions, imposing a flat Phillips curve also imposes a price level that is rigid with respect to supply shocks. In the New Keynesian model, price markup shocks need to be several orders of magnitude bigger than other shocks in order to fit the data, leading to unreasonable assessments of the magnitude of the increase in costs during inflationary episodes. To account for the facts, we propose a strategic microfoundation of shock-dependent price stickiness: prices are sticky with respect to demand shocks but flexible with respect to supply shocks. This friction is demand-intrinsic, in line with narrative accounts for the imperfect adjustment of prices. Firms can credibly justify a price increase due to a rise in costs, whereas it is harder to do so when demand increases. Inflation from supply shocks is efficient and does not justify a monetary policy response."

The strategy relies on placing more weight on financial market signals, such as the slope of the yield curve and market-based inflation expectations, than is customary. He noted that many current approaches to monetary policy strategy continue to overemphasize the now-defunct empirics of the Phillips curve, whose inflation-unemployment relationship has largely broken down over the past two decades. ?Handled properly, current financial market information can provide the basis for a better forward-looking monetary policy strategy,? he said. He also noted that these signals could help the FOMC better identify the neutral policy rate. ?The flattening yield curve and subdued market-based inflation expectations suggest that the current monetary policy stance is already neutral or possibly somewhat restrictive,? he said."

M., Hobijn, Bart",N/A,12,https://doi.org/10.21033/wp-2025-02,fedhwp:99676:original,"We provide a brief primer on how the core of usable macroeconomic theory for monetary policymakers has evolved over the past 50 years. Today’s policy discussions center on the New Keynesian (NK) synthesis, which builds on the Neoclassical growth model and the AS-AD framework. It incorporates nominal and real rigidities, financial and labor market frictions, the importance of expectations, and inspired terms used by policymakers such as “anchored inflation expectations” and “forward guidance.” While essential for communication during the Great Recession and Covid-19 pandemic, these events also revealed the NK model’s limitations. Newer models incorporating heterogeneous agents potentially offer richer policy insights but add complexity and the challenge of distilling their main policy implications going forward."

We find that there is a distinctive national factor that has contributed about one-fourth of the individual metropolitan's housing price volatility. The regional factor accounts for another one-fourth and the idiosyncratic factor explains about half of housing price fluctuations. However, at the regional level, the factors' contributions vary across a fairly wide range. Although it only has modest explanatory power of housing price volatility, the national factor seems to account for much of the price increase in the current housing boom. Interestingly, the regional factor exerts negative influence on housing prices in a fairly large number of metros lately, only to be outweighed by the national factor's positive contribution. We also explore the possible forces influencing the national factor of housing price movements, including monetary policy, population growth, real economic activity, general inflation and other asset prices."
Shoe-leather costs of inflation and policy credibility,"Pakko, Michael R.",N/A,37-50,https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/98/11/9811mp.pdf,fedlrv:25737,"Inflation can cause costly misallocations of resources as consumers seek to protect the purchasing power of their nominal assets. In this article, Michael R. Pakko discusses the nature of these distortions - known as \\""shoe-leather\\"" costs - in a model where the demand for money is motivated by a \\""shopping-time\\"" constraint. While the estimates of the shoe-leather costs of long-run inflation (implied by this model) are generally consistent with previous studies, the article goes on to show that the transition between inflation rates can involve dynamics that alter the nature of these welfare effects. Specifically, the benefits of a disinflation policy are mitigated by the gradual adjustment of the economy in response to a lower inflation rate. This transition can be particularly protracted when there is uncertainty about the credibility of the disinflation policy."
Inflation-induced valuation errors in the stock market,"Lansing, Kevin J.",N/A,N/A,http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2004/el2004-30.html,fedfel:2576,"A recent front-page article in the Wall Street Journal documented an increasing tendency among economists to move away from theories of efficient stock market valuation in favor of \\""behavioral\\"" models that emphasize the role of irrational investors (see Hilsenrath 2004). The long-run rate of return on stocks is ultimately determined by the stream of corporate earnings distributions (cash flows) that accrue to shareholders. In assigning prices to stocks, efficient valuation theory says that rational investors should discount real cash flows using real interest rates or discount nominal cash flows using nominal interest rates. Twenty-five years ago, Modigliani and Cohn (1979) put forth the hypothesis that investors may irrationally discount real cash flows using nominal interest rates - a behavioral trait that would lead to inflation-induced valuation errors. This Economic Letter examines some recent research that finds support for the Modigliani-Cohn hypothesis. In particular, studies show that the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 stock index tends to be undervalued during periods of high expected inflation (such as the late 1970s and early 1980s) and overvalued during periods of low expected inflation (such as the late 1990s and early 2000s). This result implies that the long bull market that began in 1982 can be partially attributed to the stock market's shift from a state of undervaluation to one of overvaluation. Going forward, the return on stocks could be influenced by a shift in the opposite direction."

Across most service sectors, sector-specific labor market tightness and nominal wage growth have been above prepandemic averages since 2022. The data suggest that a stronger positive relationship between labor market tightness and wage growth has emerged in the aftermath of the pandemic. The relationship between sector-specific wage growth and inflation is more varied. In the education and health services sector, higher wage growth is associated with higher inflation after about one year; in the leisure and hospitality services sector, the positive relationship is contemporaneous. I do not find a significant relationship between wage growth and inflation in the other service sectors, such as transportation or financial and business services."
Downward Nominal Rigidities and Bond Premia,"Ngo, Phuong, Gourio, François",N/A,47,https://www.chicagofed.org/-/media/publications/working-papers/2024/wp2024-09.pdf?sc_lang=en,fedhwp:98104:original,"We develop a parsimonious New Keynesian macro-finance model with downward nominal rigidities to understand secular and cyclical movements in Treasury bond premia. Downward nominal rigidities create state-dependence in output and inflation dynamics: a higher level of inflation makes prices more flexible, leading output and inflation to be more volatile, and bonds to become more risky. The model matches well the relation between the level of inflation and a number of salient macro-finance moments. Moreover, we show that empirically, inflation and output respond more strongly to productivity shocks when inflation is high, as predicted by the model."
A transitional analysis of the welfare cost of inflation,"Burdick, Clark A.",N/A,N/A,https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/wp/1997/wp9715.pdf,fedawp:13962:original,"This paper applies new computational methods for studying nonstationary dynamics to reevaluate the welfare cost of inflation. A dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents is studied. Incomplete markets induce agents to hold a fiat currency as insurance against idiosyncratic income fluctuations. Rather than comparing steady state equilibria, I measure the welfare cost of inflation by explicitly modeling the transitional dynamics that arise following a change in monetary policy. Transitional dynamics are shown to increase the welfare cost of inflation substantially. Also, contrary to conventional wisdom, transitional dynamic effects are shown to increase the benefits of reducing the inflation rate."
Post-COVID Inflation Dynamics: Higher for Longer,"Zaman, Saeed, Verbrugge, Randal J.",N/A,37,https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-202306,fedcwq:95478:original,"In the December 2022 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the median projection for four-quarter core PCE inflation in the fourth quarter of 2025 is 2.1 percent. This same SEP has unemployment rising by nine-tenths, to 4.6 percent, by the end of 2023. We assess the plausibility of this projection using a specific nonlinear model that embeds an empirically successful nonlinear Phillips curve specification into a structural model, identifying it via an underutilized data-dependent method. We model core PCE inflation using three components that align with those noted by Chair Powell in his December 14, 2022, press conference: housing, core goods, and core-services-less-housing. Our model projects that conditional on the SEP unemployment rate path and a rapid deceleration of core goods prices, core PCE inflation moderates to only 2.75 percent by the end of 2025: inflation will be higher for longer. A deep recession would be necessary to achieve the SEP’s projected inflation path.

We find strong evidence of time variation in the pool?s weights, reflecting the fact that the DSGE model with financial frictions produces superior forecasts in periods of financial distress but doesn?t perform as well in tranquil periods. The dynamic pool?s weights react in a timely fashion to changes in the environment, leading to real-time forecast improvements relative to other methods of density forecast combination, such as Bayesian model averaging, optimal (static) pools, and equal weights. We show how a policymaker dealing with model uncertainty could have used a dynamic pool to perform a counterfactual exercise (responding to the gap in labor market conditions) in the immediate aftermath of the Lehman crisis."
The Postpandemic U.S. Immigration Surge: New Facts and Inflationary Implications,"Richter, Alexander W., Zhou, Xiaoqing, Hur, Sewon, Mertens, Karel, Cheremukhin, Anton, Mau, Ron",N/A,38,https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2024/wp2407.pdf,feddwp:98919:original,"The U.S. experienced an extraordinary postpandemic surge in unauthorized immigration. This paper combines administrative data on border encounters and immigration court records with household survey data to document two new facts about these immigrants: They tend to be hand-to-mouth consumers and low-skilled workers that complement the existing workforce. We build these features into a model with capital, household heterogeneity and population growth to study the inflationary effects of this episode. Contrary to the popular view, we find little effect on inflation, as the increase in supply was largely offset by an increase in demand."

Controlling for inflation, this represented a near doubling in the relative price of housing. The retrenchment in prices that began in 2007 has so far remained small compared to the earlier increase. ; As house prices climbed, many people complained that housing had become unaffordable to middle-income Americans. As early as 1998, newspapers warned that homeownership was becoming a heavy financial burden. As sales price rises accelerated in 2003 and crested in 2006, homeownership was increasingly portrayed as the ?unattainable? American dream. ; Notwithstanding such concerns, homeownership actually rose strongly beginning in the mid-1990s and in 2004 attained its highest level ever. The more recent surge in foreclosures suggests many households indeed purchased homes they could not afford. Still, this does not necessarily imply that housing in general has become unaffordable to middle-income households. Instead, it may be that many defaults resulted from specific households purchasing specific houses whose location, size, and other attributes made their sales price too high relative to the purchasers? financial resources. ; Rappaport seeks to answer the question of whether homeownership has indeed become less affordable to middle-income Americans. He also discusses some reasons why perceptions of affordability may have decreased. past."

Our approach uses a dynamic term structure finance model estimated directly on the prices of individual inflation indexed bonds with adjustments for bond-specific liquidity and real term premia. First, we find that inflation-indexed bond liquidity premia in all three countries are sizable with significant variation. Second, we find large differences in their estimated equilibrium real rates: Brazil’s is large and volatile, Mexico’s is stable but elevated, while Chile’s is low and has fallen persistently. Although uncertain, our estimates could have important implications for the conduct of monetary policy in these three countries."

In this Commentary, we document that the extent of this bias is related to the degree of skewness in the distribution of price changes. The shift in the skewness of the cross-sectional price-change distribution during the pandemic means that median PCE and trimmed-mean PCE inflation rates have recently been understating the trend in PCE inflation by about 15 and 35 basis points, respectively."

This framework comprises 21 country/region-specific models, estimated over the period 1979Q2 to 2013Q1, and accounts for not only direct exposures of countries to El Nio shocks but also indirect effects through third-markets. We contribute to the climate-macroeconomy literature by exploiting exogenous variation in El Nio weather events over time, and their impact on different regions cross-sectionally, to causatively identify the effects of El Nio shocks on growth, inflation, energy and non-fuel commodity prices. The results show that there are considerable heterogeneities in the responses of different countries to El Nio shocks. While Australia, Chile, Indonesia, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Africa face a short-lived fall in economic activity in response to an El Nio shock, for other countries (including the United States and European region), an El Nio occurrence has a growth-enhancing effect. Furthermore, most countries in our sample experience short-run inflationary pressures as both energy and non-fuel commodity prices increase. Given these findings, macroeconomic policy formulation should take into consideration the likelihood and effects of El Nio weather episodes."

The Fed has reacted by taking important first steps to return inflation to the 2% target, Bullard said, adding that market interest rates have increased substantially, partially in response to promised Fed action.

Meanwhile, U.S. labor markets remain robust, and output is expected to continue to expand through 2022, he said."

This paper analyzes why it started and why it continued for many years. Like others, it attributes the start of inflation to analytic errors, particularly the widespread acceptance of the simple Keynesian model with its implication that monetary and fiscal policy should be coordinated. In practice, that meant that the Federal Reserve financed a large part of the fiscal deficit. This paper gives a large role to political decisionmaking. Continuation of inflation depended on political choices, analytic errors, and the entrenched belief that inflation would continue."

This literature finds that financial vulnerabilities are inherent to financial systems and tend to be procyclical. Moreover, financial vulnerabilities amplify the effects of adverse shocks to the economy, so that even a small shock to fundamentals or a small revision of beliefs can create a self-reinforcing feedback loop that impairs credit provision, lowers asset prices, and depresses economic activity and inflation. Finally, monetary policy may affect the buildup of vulnerabilities, but the sign of the impact along some of its transmission channels is theoretically ambiguous and may vary with the state of the economy."

Monetary policy alternatives for Latin America,"Quispe-Agnoli, Myriam",N/A,43-53,https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/economic-review/2001/vol86no3_quispe.pdf,fedaer:30434,"During the 1990s, many Latin American countries began to address their problems with recession, inflation, and unemployment through dramatic economic reforms and monetary policy strategies that included exchange rate pegs, monetary aggregate targeting, or inflation targeting. Inflation targeting, in particular, had begun to lower inflation rates and to stabilize or increase real economic growth in countries such as New Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom. But has inflation targeting proved as successful for Latin American economies? ; This article describes the recent history of monetary policy in Latin America, focusing on the strategies implemented by Argentina, Panama, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Colombia, and Brazil. For the most part their policies were successful: the inflation rate was lower in the 1990s than during the previous decade while average real economic growth more than doubled. But financial crises in recent years have highlighted the region's continuing vulnerability to international capital market volatility and other external and domestic shocks. ; The author believes that the Latin American experience suggests some lessons about various policies' relative costs and benefits and the importance of the underlying economic and political environment in determining the ultimate success of alternative monetary policy regimes. She concludes that fiscal discipline, policy credibility, and the role of the exchange rate are critical factors that must be addressed to ensure the sustainability of economic policy."
The lead of output over inflation in sticky price models,"Kiley, Michael T.",N/A,N/A,http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/1996/199633/199633abs.html,fedgfe:35214:original,"Output growth is negatively correlated with inflation, and detrended output is positively correlated with inflation, in the major North American and European economies. In addition, output growth and detrended output lead inflation. I explore the consistency of these correlations with three models of price adjustment: the partial adjustment model, a staggered price setting model, and the P-bar model. The ratio of the variance of supply to demand shocks necessary to match the pattern of output- inflation correlations can be ranked across the three models; the P-Bar model requires the lowest ratio, and the partial adjustment model requires the highest ratio. These results reveal that the recent burst of researchers using the partial adjustment model will find a larger role for supply shocks than alternative models of price rigidity."

The March survey, which was fielded between March 2 and 31, records a substantial deterioration in financial and economic expectations, including sharp declines in household income and spending growth expectations. As shown in the first two columns of the table below, the median expected year-ahead growth in income and spending declined from 2.7 percent and 3.1 percent in February to 2.1 percent and 2.3 percent in March, respectively. Similarly, expectations about home price growth plunged from 3.1 percent in February to 1.3 percent in March. The March reading for one-year home price growth expectations came in about 1.4 percentage points below the previous low for the series, which stretches back to June 2013."

Historically, over long horizons, money and prices have been closely tied together, but over the past decade, prices have risen only modestly while base money (reserves plus currency) has grown substantially. A macroeconomic model helps explain this behavior and suggests some potential limits to the Fed's ability to increase the size of its balance sheet indefinitely while remaining consistent with its inflation-targeting policy."
Inflation targeting under imperfect knowledge,"Williams, John C., Orphanides, Athanasios",N/A,1-23,https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/er1-23.pdf,fedfer:23463,"A central tenet of inflation targeting is that establishing and maintaining well-anchored inflation expectations are essential. In this paper, we reexamine the role of key elements of the inflation targeting framework towards this end, in the context of an economy where economic agents have an imperfect understanding of the macroeconomic landscape within which the public forms expectations and policymakers must formulate and implement monetary policy. Using an estimated model of the U.S. economy, we show that monetary policy rules that would perform well under the assumption of rational expectations can perform very poorly when we introduce imperfect knowledge. We then examine the performance of an easily implemented policy rule that incorporates three key characteristics of inflation targeting: transparency, commitment to maintaining price stability, and close monitoring of inflation expectations, and find that all three play an important role in assuring its success. Our analysis suggests that simple difference rules in the spirit of Knut Wicksell excel at tethering inflation expectations to the central banks goal and in so doing achieve superior stabilization of inflation and economic activity in an environment of imperfect knowledge."
Price level versus inflation rate targets in an open economy with overlapping wage contracts,"Hansen, Eric",N/A,N/A,,fedfpb:11747:original,The standard result in models of sticky prices is that an inflation rate target is better than a price level target at minimizing the variance of real output.  This paper provides a contradictory result: a price level target may be preferred in an economy that is characterized by flexible prices in one sector and sticky prices in another sector.  An example is a highly open economy that has flexible prices in the tradeable goods sector and sticky prices (due to Taylor-type overlapping wage contracts) in the non-tradeable goods sector.  The robustness of these results is confirmed for variants of the model where wage contracts are based on relative real wages (following Fuhrer/Moore (1995) and when monetary policy has a one-period implementation lag relative to wage setters.  The paper discusses the implications of the result in the light of New Zealand's current monetary policy framework.

A hallmark of this approach is that the central bank focuses on fighting inflation when inflation is high, but focuses on stabilizing output when inflation is low. The implied policy rule is nonlinear. This paper compares the behavior of inflation and output under opportunistic and conventional linear policies. Using stochastic simulations of a small-scale rational expectations model, we study the cost and time required to achieve a given disinflation, as well as the steady-state distributions of inflation and output under the various rules."

Bullard said that the pandemic fiscal-monetary response created too much inflation. To eliminate the excess inflation, the fiscal-monetary response must be countered, he noted, adding that this is happening.

The fiscal stimulus is receding, and monetary policy has been adjusted rapidly in the last year to better align with traditional central bank strategy, he said. “Accordingly, the prospects for continued disinflation are good but not guaranteed,” he added."

Tightness is always desirable in a monetary policy instrument; when is transparency? When a government cannot commit to follow a given policy.

We show that if the instruments are equally tight and a government cannot commit to a policy, then the exchange rate's greater transparency gives it an advantage as a monetary policy instrument."

Hoenig offered a long-term perspective on some current and future challenges facing monetary policy due to ongoing changes in the structure of the economy and financial markets. These changes can affect monetary policy in several ways. Some complicate the process of deciding when a policy action should be taken--that is, when the FOMC should change the federal funds rate target. Others may affect the implementation of monetary policy by requiring changes in operating procedures or the institutional framework of policy.> Mr. Hoenig focused on three specific issues. The first is the apparent change in the structure of the inflation process in recent years that has made it more difficult to produce reliable inflation forecasts. This development has led to some subtle but significant changes in monetary policy decision-making. The second is the impact of a shrinking supply of Treasury securities on monetary policy, which has already affected yield spreads and the usefulness of some financial market data as indicators for monetary policy. Going forward, this development could also affect how the Fed implements policy. The third issue is the more distant prospect that the spread of e-money could undermine the role of central banks in conducting monetary policy. This prospect could ultimately affect the implementation of monetary policy in a very fundamental way by reducing or even eliminating the demand for central bank money."

Learning and monetary policy shifts,"Schorfheide, Frank",N/A,N/A,https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/wp/2003/wp0323.pdf,fedawp:13583:original,"This paper estimates a dynamic stochastic equilibrium model in which agents use a Bayesian rule to learn about the state of monetary policy. Monetary policy follows a nominal interest rate rule that is subject to regime shifts. The following results are obtained. First, the author's policy regime estimates are consistent with the popular view that policy was marked by a shift to a high-inflation regime in the early 1970s, which ended with Volcker's stabilization policy at the beginning of the 1980s. Second, while Bayesian posterior odds favor the \""full-information\"" version of the model in which agents know the policy regime, the fall of inflation and interest rates in the disinflation episode in the early 1980s is better captured by the delayed response of the \""learning\"" specification. Third, the author examines the magnitude of the expectations-formation effect of monetary policy interventions in the \""learning\"" specification by comparing impulse responses to a version of the model in which agents ignore the information contained in current and past monetary policy shocks about the likelihood of a regime shift."
Inflation dynamics when inflation is near zero,"Fuhrer, Jeffrey C., Tootell, Geoffrey M. B., Olivei, Giovanni P.",N/A,N/A,http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp2011/wp1117.htm,fedbwp:7275:original,"This paper discusses the likely evolution of U.S. inflation in the near and medium term on the basis of (1) past U.S. experience with very low levels of inflation, (2) the most recent Japanese experience with deflation, and (3) recent U.S. micro evidence on downward nominal wage rigidity. Our findings question the view that stable long-run inflation expectations and downward nominal wage rigidity will provide sufficient support to prices such that deflation can be avoided. We show that an inflation model fitted on Japanese data over the past 20 years, which accounts for both short- and long-run inflation expectations, matches the recent U.S. inflation experience quite well. While the model indicates that U.S. inflation might be subject to a lower bound, it does not rule out a prolonged period of mild deflation going forward. In addition, our micro evidence on wages suggests no obvious downward rigidity in the firm's wage costs, downward rigidity in individual wages notwithstanding. As a consequence, downward nominal wage rigidity may provide little offset to deflationary pressures in the current U.S. situation, despite some circumstantial evidence that this channel might have been at work in the past."
Understanding Which Prices Affect Inflation Expectations,"Campos, Chris, Pedemonte, Mathieu, McMain, Michael",N/A,7,https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-ec-202206,fedcec:94039,"Inflation expectations have an impact on one’s economic behavior. We show that the inflation expectations of professional forecasters and consumers are predicted by very different prices. While professional forecasters weigh prices similar to the consumer price index, consumers seem to focus on prices they see more often, such as those for food and new vehicles. These are also prices that have seen disproportionally high volatility since the onset of the pandemic. We argue that heterogeneity in the importance of component-specific inflation can have relevant economic implications and disproportionate effects on consumers’ inflation expectations that can, in turn, affect economic behavior."
The current state of the U.S. and Mexican economies: where do we go from here?,"Fisher, Richard W.",N/A,N/A,http://dallasfed.org/news/speeches/fisher/2006/fs060925.cfm,feddsp:28835,"\""As I sit at the FOMC table, I continue to fret more about inflation than I do about growth. While I am well aware of the risks to economic growth, the history of inverted yield curves, and the ever present possibility of exogenous shocks in a politically hazardous world, the 'balance of risk,' in my book, is still tilted to the inflation side of the equation.\"" ; Remarks at a Policy Forum hosted by the El Paso Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and Monterrey Branch of the Banco de Mexico, Monterrey, N.L., Mexico, September 25, 2006"
Commentary on Is inflation targeting best-practice monetary policy?,"Friedman, Benjamin M.",N/A,N/A,https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/04/07/Friedman.pdf,fedlrv:24773,N/A
Tests of the market's reaction to federal funds rate target changes,"Thornton, Daniel L.",N/A,25-36,https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/98/11/9811dt.pdf,fedlrv:25469,"In this article, Daniel L. Thornton tests several hypotheses about the market's reactions to changes in the Federal Reserve's federal funds rate target. Thornton finds that short-term rates and long-term rates responded differently to funds rate target changes when target changes were accompanied by a change in the discount rate. He presents evidence that the smaller response of long-term rates (in these instances) is due to the market revising its inflation outlook when the target is changed. Thornton finds no evidence that the size of the market's response varies with the size of the target change; however, he does find that the response to target changes is somewhat larger when the target change is the first change in a new direction. The reader is cautioned, however, that some of his results are based on a very small number of target changes."
"Interest rate rules, endogenous cycles, and chaotic dynamics in open economies","Airaudo, Marco, Zanna, Luis-Felipe",N/A,N/A,http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2005/849/default.htm,fedgif:36821:original,"In this paper we present an extensive analysis of the consequences for global equilibrium determinacy of implementing active interest rate rules (i.e. monetary rules where the nominal interest rate responds more than proportionally to changes in inflation) in flexible-price open economies. We show that conditions under which these rules generate aggregate instability by inducing cyclical and chaotic equilibrium dynamics depend on particular characteristics of open economies such as the degree of (trade) openness and the degree of exchange rate pass-through implied by the presence of non-traded distribution costs. For instance, we find that a forward-looking rule is more prone to induce endogenous cyclical and chaotic dynamics the more open the economy and the higher the degree of exchange rate pass-through. The existence of these dynamics and their dependence on the degree of openness are in general robust to different timings of the rule (forward-looking versus contemporaneous rules), to the use of alternative measures of inflation in the rule (CPI versus Core inflation), as well as to changes in the timing of real money balances in liquidity services (\""cash-when-I-am-done\"" timing versus \""cash-in-advance\"" timing)."
Real exchange rate movements in high inflation countries,"Rogers, John H., Wang, Ping",N/A,N/A,http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/1995/501/default.htm,fedgif:37110:original,"We empirically assess the sources of fluctuations in the real exchange rates of four high inflation countries, for which monetary shocks are generally believed to be predominant. In a benchmark model we identify fiscal, monetary, and output shocks based on a general-equilibrium optimizing model. We then estimate two alternative extensions. In the first, we decompose the output shock into supply and demand disturbances; in the second, the monetary shock is further decomposed into money supply and nominal exchange rate disturbances. Monetary shocks are found to be generally significant. Real shocks, especially those associated with government policy restrictions on the flow of currency, income from foreign investments, capital, and/or goods, are uniformly more influential however. The paper suggests that analyses of real exchange rates in high inflation economies using models emphasizing monetary shocks and sticky prices could be improved by not negtecting real shocks."
"Money, interest rates, and exchange rates with endogenously segmented asset markets","Kehoe, Patrick J., Alvarez, Fernando, Atkeson, Andrew",N/A,N/A,http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/common/pub_detail.cfm?pb_autonum_id=822,fedmwp:42606:original,"This paper analyzes the effects of money injections on interest rates and exchange rates in a model in which agents must pay a Baumol-Tobin style fixed cost to exchange bonds and money. Asset markets are endogenously segmented because this fixed cost leads agents to trade bonds and money only infrequently. When the government injects money through an open market operation, only those agents that are currently trading absorb these injections. Through their impact on these agents? consumption, these money injections affect real interest rates and real exchange rates. We show that the model generates the observed negative relation between expected inflation and real interest rates. With moderate amounts of segmentation, the model also generates other observed features of the data: persistent liquidity effects in interest rates and volatile and persistent exchange rates. A standard model with no fixed costs can produce none of these features."
"Pandemic Ebbs and Flows: Economic Data, Inflation Concerns, and Policymaking","Rosengren, Eric",N/A,12,https://www.bostonfed.org/news-and-events/speeches/2021/pandemic-ebbs-and-flows-economic-data-inflation-concerns-and-policymaking.aspx,fedbsp:91747,"With a shock as large as the pandemic, policymakers need to be alert to potential changes to the economy. To date, inflation expectations and the underlying inflation rate look to be stable. It is important to keep in mind the difficulty that was experienced in achieving inflation of 2 percent in the United States and most of the developed world after the Great Financial Crisis.  As a result, my perspective is that the emphasis on actual outcomes rather than forecasts of rising inflationary pressures when setting monetary policy appears justified. However, given the noise in the data, it will be important to carefully filter underlying inflation trends as labor markets tighten."
