"Discussion of Preston, \""Learning about monetary policy rules when long-horizon expectations matter\""","Honkapohja, Seppo",N/A,N/A,https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/wp/2003/wp0319.pdf,fedawp:13686:original,"The design of interest rate rules for conducting monetary policy have recently been examined for two key concerns. The first issue is determinacy of equilibria. Indeterminacy (multiplicity of stationary rational expectations equilibria) is a concern in models of monopolistic competition and price stickiness are currently a popular framework for the study of monetary policy. The second issue is stability of equilibria under adaptive learning. Some interest rate rules do not perform well when the expectations of the agents get out of equilibrium, e.g. as a result of structural shifts."
Bank capital standards for foreign exchange and other market risks,"Levonian, Mark E.",N/A,3-18,https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/94-1_3-18.pdf,fedfer:23113,"The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision has proposed methods for incorporating consideration of market risks--exchange rate, interest rate, and equity price risks--into risk-based capital standards for banks.  This paper shows that the separate and seemingly different proposed approaches to the three sources of risk are consistent with one another, reflecting a single unifying theme.  That theme is the measurement of risk through a weighting of two different measures of portfolio size, the gross position and the net position.  A simple theoretical model demonstrates that such an approach can be viewed as a simple (specifically, an affine) approximation to a portfolio variance calculation based on the full variance-covariance matrix of market returns, and thus provides a reasonable basis for a practical approach to capital standards.  An empirical test of one part of the framework, the proposal for exchange rate risk, shows that the approximation may be very accurate:  the proposed Basle approach captures over 95 percent of the variation in foreign exchange risk across a sample of banks from the Twelfth Federal Reserve District."
Banking across borders with heterogeneous banks,"Niepmann, Friederike",N/A,55 pages,https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr609.pdf,fednsr:12085,"Individual banks differ substantially in their foreign operations. This paper introduces heterogeneous banks into a general equilibrium framework of banking across borders to explain the documented variation. While the model matches existing micro and macro evidence, novel and unexplored predictions of the theory are also strongly supported by the data: The efficiency of the least efficient bank active in a host country increases the greater the impediments to banking across borders and the efficiency of the banking sector in the host country. There is also evidence of a tradeoff between proximity and fixed costs in banking. Banks hold more assets and liabilities in foreign affiliates relative to cross-border positions if the target country is further away and the cost of foreign direct investment is low. These results suggest that fixed costs play a crucial role in the foreign activities of banks."
Entry dynamics and the decline in exchange-rate pass-through,"Gust, Christopher J., Vigfusson, Robert J., Leduc, Sylvain",N/A,N/A,http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2010/1008/default.htm,fedgif:36730:original,"The degree of exchange-rate pass-through to import prices is low. An average pass-through estimate for the 1980s would be roughly 50 percent for the United States implying that, following a 10 percent depreciation of the dollar, a foreign exporter selling to the U.S. market would raise its price in the United States by 5 percent. Moreover, substantial evidence indicates that the degree of pass-through has since declined to about 30 percent. ; Gust, Leduc, and Vigfusson (2010) demonstrate that, in the presence of pricing complementarity, trade integration spurred by lower costs for importers can account for a significant portion of the decline in pass-through. In our framework, pass-through declines solely because of markup adjustments along the intensive margin. ; In this paper, we model how the entry and exit decisions of exporting firms affect pass-through. This is particularly important since the decline in pass-through has occurred as a greater concentration of foreign firms are exporting to the United States. ; We find that the effect of entry on pass-through is quantitatively small and is more than offset by the adjustment of markups that arise only along the intensive margin. Even though entry has a relatively small impact on pass-through, it nevertheless plays an important role in accounting for the secular rise in imports relative to GDP. In particular, our model suggests that over 3/4 of the rise in the U.S. import share since the early 1980s is due to trade in new goods. Thus, a key insight of this paper is that adjustment of markups that occur along the intensive margin are quantitatively more important in accounting for secular changes in pass-through than adjustments that occur along the extensive margin."
"Managing a New Policy Framework: Paul Volcker, the St. Louis Fed, and the 1979-82 War on Inflation","Wheelock, David C., Kliesen, Kevin L.",1979,31 pages,https://s3.amazonaws.com/real.stlouisfed.org/wp/2020/2020-022.pdf,fedlwp:88437:original,"In October 1979, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker persuaded his FOMC colleagues to adopt a new policy framework that i) accepted responsibility for controlling inflation and ii) implemented new operating procedures to control the growth of monetary aggregates in an effort to restore price stability. These moves were strongly supported by monetarist-oriented economists, including the leadership and staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The next three years saw inflation peak and then fall sharply, but also two recessions and considerable volatility in interest rates and money supply growth rates. This article reviews the episode through the lens of speeches and FOMC meeting statements of Volcker and St. Louis Fed president Lawrence Roos, and articles by Roos’ staff. The FOMC adopted monetarist principles to establish the Fed’s anti-inflation credibility but Volcker was willing to accept deviations of money growth from the FOMC’s targets, unlike Roos, who viewed the targets as sacrosanct. The FOMC abandoned monetary aggregates in October 1982, but preserved the Fed’s commitment to price stability. The episode illustrates how Volcker used a change in operating procedures to alter policy fundamentally, and later adapt the procedures to changed circumstances without abandoning the foundational features of the policy."
Recent developments in the analysis of monetary policy rules,"McCallum, Bennett T.",N/A,3-12,https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/99/11/9911bm.pdf,fedlrv:25087,"After a brief review of key developments in application of monetary theory to policy analysis, Bennett T. McCallum describes the central aspects of the typical framework used to analyze monetary policy rules. He reviews the methods used to study the effects of policy behavior and provides an example of how two rules (the McCallum rule and the Taylor rule) can be used to investigate recent monetary policy in Japan. His example shows why it may be important for central banks to develop monetary policy procedures based on monetary-aggregate as well as interest-rate instruments."
Out from the shadows : The run on shadow banking and a framework for reform,"Haltom, Renee Courtois",N/A,22-25,https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/econ_focus/2010/q3/pdf/feature3.pdf,fedrrf:62131,Related links: https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/econ_focus/2010/q3/feature3_weblinks.cfm
Understanding Climate Damages: Consumption versus Investment,"Fried, Stephie, Casey, Gregory, Gibson, Matthew",N/A,61,https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/wp2022-21.pdf,fedfwp:94890:original,"Existing climate-economy models use aggregate damage functions to model the effects of climate change. This approach assumes climate change has equal impacts on the productivity of firms that produce consumption and investment goods or services. We show the split between damage to consumption and investment productivity matters for the dynamic consequences of climate change. Drawing on the structural transformation literature, we develop a framework that incorporates heterogeneous climate damages. When investment is more vulnerable to climate, we find short-run consumption losses will be smaller than leading models with aggregate damage functions suggest, but long-run consumption losses will be larger. We quantify these effects for the climate damage from heat stress and find that accounting for heterogeneous damages increases the welfare cost of climate change by approximately 4 to 24 percent, depending on the discount factor."
Stability of funding models: an analytical framework,"Yorulmazer, Tanju, Eisenbach, Thomas M., McAndrews, James J., Keister, Todd",N/A,29-47,https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/epr/2014/1402yor3.pdf,fednep:19766,"With the recent financial crisis, many financial intermediaries experienced strains created by declining asset values and a loss of funding sources. In reviewing these stress events, one notices that some arrangements appear to have been more stable?that is, better able to withstand shocks to their asset values and/or funding sources?than others. Because the precise determinants of this stability are not well understood, gaining a better grasp of them is a critical task for market participants and policymakers as they try to design more resilient arrangements and improve financial regulation. This article uses a simple analytical framework to illustrate the determinants of a financial intermediary?s ability to survive stress events. An intermediary in the framework faces two types of risk: the value of its assets may decline and/or its short-term creditors may decide not to roll over their debt. The authors measure stability by looking at the combinations of shocks the intermediary can experience while remaining solvent. They study how stability depends on the intermediary?s balance-sheet characteristics, such as its leverage, the maturity structure of its debt, and the liquidity and riskiness of its asset portfolio. They also show how the framework can be applied to examine current policy issues, including liquidity requirements, discount window policy, and different approaches to reforming money market mutual funds."
House Price Growth Interdependencies and Comovement,"Cohen, Jeffrey P., Soques, Daniel, Coughlin, Cletus C.",N/A,35 pages,https://s3.amazonaws.com/real.stlouisfed.org/wp/2019/2019-028.pdf,fedlwp:9344:89570,"This paper examines house price comovement across U.S. metropolitan areas (MSAs). We develop a Markov-switching framework that includes a spatial similarity element based on distances between MSAs. Our approach allows for house price comovements that occur due to similar timing of downturns across groups or clusters of MSAs. The inclusion of the spatial element improves the model fit compared to a standard endogenous clustering model. We find seven clusters of MSAs, where each cluster experiences idiosyncratic house price downturns, plus one distinct national house price cycle. Notably, only the housing downturn associated with the Great Recession spread across all the MSAs in our sample; all other house price downturns remained contained to a single cluster. We also identify MSA economic and geographic characteristics that correlate with cluster membership.  In addition, while prior research has found housing and business cycles to be related closely at the national level, we find very different house price comovement and employment comovement across clusters and across MSAs."
Assessing supervisory scenarios for interest rate risk,"Lopez, Jose A., Christensen, Jens H. E.",N/A,N/A,http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/el2015-29.pdf,fedfel:1663,"A new proposal by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision for setting the amount of capital banks must hold against potential losses from interest rate risk uses only a few, very stylized scenarios. Analysis shows the proposed scenarios are extremely unlikely to occur. While they may be appropriate for setting bank capital guidelines, they are much less relevant for everyday risk management. Instead, using a modeling framework with a plausible range of interest rate scenarios would be more relevant to help banks manage their interest rate risk."
Breathing room for beta,"Kozicki, Sharon, Shen, Pu",N/A,N/A,,fedkrw:40740:original,"This paper argues that a test of beta insignificance, commonly used in empirical studies of the CAPM, predisposes studies toward rejecting the CAPM. Under the null hypothesis of these tests, the CAPM is false. Consequently, insufficient evidence to reject the null is taken as sufficient evidence to reject the CAPM. Simulations suggest that this framework typically leads to false rejection rates of more than 1/2. An alternative test, with a null hypothesis consistent with the CAPM, is proposed. Based on statistics from published studies, the proposed test does not reject the CAPM."
"A note on the cointegration of consumption, income, and wealth","Rudd, Jeremy B., Whelan, Karl",N/A,N/A,http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2002/200253/200253abs.html,fedgfe:34984:original,"Lettau and Ludvigson (2001) argue that a log-linearized approximation to an aggregate budget constraint predicts that log consumption, assets, and labor income will be cointegrated. They conclude that this cointegrating relationship is present in U.S. data, and that the estimated cointegrating residual forecasts future asset growth. This note examines whether the cointegrating relationship suggested by Lettau and Ludvigson's theoretical framework actually exists. We demonstrate that we cannot reject the hypothesis that cointegration is absent from the data once we employ measures of consumption, assets, and labor income that are jointly consistent with an underlying budget constraint. By contrast, Lettau and Ludvigson use a set of variables that do not belong together in an aggregate budget constraint, thereby testing a cointegrating relationship that is not implied by their theory."
Introducing financial frictions and unemployment into a small open economy model,"Christiano, Lawrence J., Trabandt, Mathias, Walentin, Karl",N/A,N/A,http://www.frbatlanta.org/documents/cqer/publicationscq/cqerwp/cqer_wp10-04.pdf,fedacq:33508:original,"The current financial crisis has made it abundantly clear that business cycle modeling can no longer abstract from financial factors. It is also clear that the current standard approach of modeling labor markets without explicit unemployment has its limitations. We extend what is becoming the standard new Keynesian model in three dimensions. First, we incorporate financial frictions in the accumulation and management of capital. Second, we model the labor market using a search and matching framework. Third, we extend the model into a small open economy setting. Finally, we estimate the model using Bayesian techniques with Swedish data. Our main results are as follows: (1) The financial shock to entrepreneurial wealth is pivotal for explaining business cycle fluctuations. It accounts for two-thirds of the variance in investment and a quarter of the variance in GDP. (2) The marginal efficiency of investment shock has very limited importance. The reason for this is that we match financial market data. (3) In contrast to the existing literature on estimated DSGE models, our model does not need any wage markup shocks or similar shocks with low autocorrelation to match the data. Furthermore, the low-frequency labor preference shock that we do allow is not important in explaining GDP. (4) The tightness of the labor market is unimportant for the cost of adjusting the workforce. In other words, there are costs of hiring but no significant costs of vacancy postings per se."
"Bad Investments and Missed Opportunities? Capital Flows to Asia and Latin America, 1950-2007","Restrepo-Echavarria, Paulina, Wright, Mark L. J., Ohanian, Lee E.",1950,113 pages,https://s3.amazonaws.com/real.stlouisfed.org/wp/2014/2014-038.pdf,fedlwp:10343:original,"After World War II, international capital flowed into slow-growing Latin America rather than fast-growing Asia. This is surprising as, everything else equal, fast growth should imply high capital returns. This paper develops a capital flow accounting framework to quantify the role of different factor market distortions in producing these patterns. Surprisingly, we find that distortions in labor markets ? rather than domestic or international capital markets ? account for the bulk of these flows. Labor market distortions that indirectly depress investment incentives by lowering equilibrium labor supply explain two-thirds of observed flows, while their removal accounts for much of Asia?s growth."
Macroeconomic Uncertainty Through the Lens of Professional Forecasters,"Sekkel, Rodrigo, Jo, Soojin",N/A,36 pages,https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/research/papers/2017/wp1702.pdf,feddwp:27541:original,"We analyze the evolution of macroeconomic uncertainty in the United States, based on the forecast errors of consensus survey forecasts of various economic indicators. Comprehensive information contained in the survey forecasts enables us to capture a real-time subjective measure of uncertainty in a simple framework. We jointly model and estimate macroeconomic (common) and indicator-specific uncertainties of four indicators, using a factor stochastic volatility model. Our macroeconomic uncertainty has three major spikes aligned with the 1973?75, 1980, and 2007?09 recessions, while other recessions were characterized by increases in indicator-specific uncertainties. We also show that the selection of data vintages affects the estimates and relative size of jumps in estimated uncertainty series. Finally, our macroeconomic uncertainty has a persistent negative impact on real economic activity, rather than producing ?wait-and-see? dynamics."
Volatility puzzles: a unified framework for gauging return-volatility regressions,"Bollerslev, Tim, Zhou, Hao",N/A,N/A,http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2003/200340/200340abs.html,fedgfe:33851:original,"This paper provides a simple unified framework for assessing the empirical linkages between returns and realized and implied volatilities. First, we show that whereas the volatility feedback effect as measured by the sign of the correlation between contemporaneous return and realized volatility depends importantly on the underlying structural model parameters, the correlation between return and implied volatility is unambiguously positive for all reasonable parameter configurations. Second, the lagged return-volatility asymmetry, or the leverage effect, is always stronger for implied than realized volatility. Third, implied volatilities generally provide downward biased forecasts of subsequent realized volatilities. Our results help explain previous findings reported in the extant empirical literature, and is further corroborated by new estimation results for a sample of monthly returns and implied and realized volatilities for the aggregate S&P market index."
"The relationship between expected inflation, disagreement, and uncertainty: evidence from matched point and density forecasts","Rich, Robert W., Tracy, Joseph",N/A,48 pages,https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr253.html,fednsr:12316,"This paper examines matched point and density forecasts of inflation from the Survey of Professional Forecasters to analyze the relationship between expected inflation, disagreement, and uncertainty. We extend previous studies through our data construction and estimation methodology. Specifically, we derive measures of disagreement and uncertainty by using a decomposition proposed in earlier research by Wallis and by applying the concept of entropy from information theory. We also undertake the empirical analysis within a seemingly unrelated regression framework. Our results offer mixed support for the propositions that disagreement is a useful proxy for uncertainty and that increases in expected inflation are accompanied by heightened inflation uncertainty. However, we document a robust, quantitatively and statistically significant positive association between disagreement and expected inflation."
Managing Monetary Policy Normalization,"Benigno, Gianluca, Benigno, Pierpaolo",N/A,58,https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr1015.pdf,fednsr:94241,"We propose a new framework for monetary policy analysis to study monetary policy normalization when exiting a liquidity trap. The optimal combination of reserves and interest rate policy requires an increase in liquidity (reserves) a few quarters after the policy rate is set at the effective lower bound. Removal of accommodation requires that quantitative tightening starts before the liftoff of the policy rate. Moreover, the withdrawal of liquidity takes place at a very slow pace relative to the normalization of the policy rate."
Financial capital and the macroeconomy: a quantitative framework,"Sim, Jae W., Kiley, Michael T.",N/A,N/A,http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2011/201127/201127abs.html,fedgfe:34420:original,"Financial intermediation transforms short-term liquid assets into long-term capital assets. As a result, risk taking, in the form of long-term commitments despite unresolved short-term funding risk, is an essential element of intermediation. If such funding risk must be addressed by costly recapitalization and/or distressed asset sales due to capital market frictions, an increase in uncertainty can cause a disruption in the intermediation process by forcing risk-neutral intermediaries to behave in a risk-averse manner. Our analysis examines this behavior theoretically and empirically. We first develop a dynamic macroeconomic model in which the balance sheet/liquidity condition of financial intermediaries plays an important role in the determination of asset prices and economic activity under time-varying uncertainty. Second, we present new evidence on the importance of uncertainty facing financial intermediaries for credit terms and volume and for aggregate economic activity, thereby partially quantifying the significance of capital market frictions. We adopt a structural identification strategy in which the predictions of our theory, in the form of sign restrictions, play an important role."
An Empirical Economic Assessment of the Costs and Benefits of Bank Capital in the United States,"Firestone, Simon, Lorenc, Amy, Ranish, Ben",N/A,N/A,https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2019/07/12/an-empirical-economic-assessment-of-the-costs-and-benefits-of-bank-capital-in-the-united-states,fedlrv:24776,"We evaluate the economic costs and benefits of bank capital in the United States. The analysis is similar to that found in previous studies, though we tailor it to the specific features and experience of the U.S. financial system. We also make adjustments to account for the impact of liquidity- and resolution-related regulations on the probability of a financial crisis. We find that the level of capital that maximizes the difference between total benefits and total costs ranges from just over 13 percent to 26 percent. This range reflects a high degree of uncertainty and latitude in specifying important study parameters that have a significant influence on the resulting optimal capital level, such as the output costs of a financial crisis or the effect of increased bank capital on economic output. Finally, the article discusses a range of considerations and factors that are not included in the cost-benefit framework that could have a substantial impact on estimated optimal capital levels."

Decomposing Medical-Care Expenditure Growth,"Shapiro, Adam Hale, Liebman, Eli, Dunn, Abe",N/A,31 pages,https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp12-26bk.pdf,fedfwp:8949:original,"Medical-care expenditures have been rising rapidly, accounting for almost one-fifth of GDP in 2009. In this study, we assess the sources of the rising medical-care expenditures in the commercial sector. We employ a novel framework for decomposing expenditure growth into four components at the disease level: service price growth, service utilization growth, treated disease prevalence growth, and demographic shift. The decomposition shows that growth in prices and treated prevalence are the primary drivers of medical-care expenditure growth over the 2003 to 2007 period. There was no growth in service utilization at the aggregate level over this period. Price and utilization growth were especially large for the treatment of malignant neoplasms. For many conditions, treated prevalence has shifted towards preventive treatment and away from treatment for late-stage illnesses."
A Market Interpretation of Treatment Effects,"Mulligan, Casey B., Minton, Robert",N/A,34 p.,https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2024096pap.pdf,fedgfe:99338:original,"Markets, likened to an invisible hand, often appear to contradict econometric assumptions that rule out spillovers of one person’s treatment on another’s outcomes.  This paper provides a simple statistical framework highlighting that controls are indirectly affected by the treatment through the market.  Further, the effect of the treatment on the treated reveals only part of the consequence for the treated of treating the entire market.  When combined with economic theory, our framework leads to a new application of Marshall’s Laws of Derived Demand that relates econometric estimates of treatment effects in the marketplace to the substitution and scale effects of demand theory.  We show how treatment-effect estimators can diverge – both in magnitude and direction – from the causal effects of treatment on the treated or counterfactual policies treating all market participants.  The framework shows how the consequences of targeted treatments reveal the effects of marketwide treatments, and the role of market frictions in that inference.  Examples from labor, public finance, economic geography, development, and the macro literature on the “missing intercept” are provided."
A Macroeconomic Model with Financial Panics,"Gertler, Mark, Prestipino, Andrea, Kiyotaki, Nobuhiro",N/A,63 pages,https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/files/ifdp1219.pdf,fedgif:36839:original,This paper incorporates banks and banking panics within a conventional macroeconomic framework to analyze the dynamics of a financial crisis of the kind recently experienced. We are particularly interested in characterizing the sudden and discrete nature of the banking panics as well as the circumstances that makes an economy vulnerable to such panics in some instances but not in others. Having a conventional macroeconomic model allows us to study the channels by which the crisis affects real activity and the effects of policies in containing crises.
Monetary policy and global equilibria in a production economy,"Wolman, Alexander L., Hursey, Tim",N/A,317-337,https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/RichmondFedOrg/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2010/q4/pdf/wolman.pdf,fedreq:26362,"In linear macroeconomic models, an active Taylor rule for monetary policy can guarantee a locally unique nonexplosive equilibrium. In a series of articles, Benhabib, Schmitt-Groh, and Uribe looked beyond the local dynamics and showed that active Taylor rules could interact with the zero bound on nominal interest rates to generate multiple equilibria, including a steady-state equilibrium with inflation below target. Recently, the persistence of low inflation and low nominal interest rates has brought attention to Benhabib, Schmitt-Groh, and Uribe's work in policy circles. We provide an introduction to this line of research. The specific model used here?Rotemberg price setting in discrete time?fits neatly into the frameworks typically used for applied monetary policy analysis.
