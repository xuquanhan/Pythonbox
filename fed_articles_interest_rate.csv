"Discussion of Preston, \""Learning about monetary policy rules when long-horizon expectations matter\""","Honkapohja, Seppo",N/A,N/A,https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/wp/2003/wp0319.pdf,fedawp:13686:original,"The design of interest rate rules for conducting monetary policy have recently been examined for two key concerns. The first issue is determinacy of equilibria. Indeterminacy (multiplicity of stationary rational expectations equilibria) is a concern in models of monopolistic competition and price stickiness are currently a popular framework for the study of monetary policy. The second issue is stability of equilibria under adaptive learning. Some interest rate rules do not perform well when the expectations of the agents get out of equilibrium, e.g. as a result of structural shifts."
Default and the maturity structure in sovereign bonds,"Ramanarayanan, Ananth, Arellano, Cristina",N/A,N/A,http://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/pub_display.cfm?id=4012,fedmsr:4798,"This paper studies the maturity composition and the term structure of interest rate spreads of government debt in emerging markets. In the data, when interest rate spreads rise, debt maturity shortens and the spread on short-term bonds is higher than on long-term bonds. To account for this pattern, we build a dynamic model of international borrowing with endogenous default and multiple maturities of debt. Short-term debt can deliver higher immediate consumption than long-term debt; large long-term loans are not available because the borrower cannot commit to save in the near future towards repayment in the far future. However, issuing long-term debt can insure against the need to roll-over short-term debt at high interest rate spreads. The trade-off between these two benefits is quantitatively important for understanding the maturity composition in emerging markets. When calibrated to data from Brazil, the model matches the dynamics in the maturity of debt issuances and its comovement with the level of spreads across maturities."
Bank capital standards for foreign exchange and other market risks,"Levonian, Mark E.",N/A,3-18,https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/94-1_3-18.pdf,fedfer:23113,"The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision has proposed methods for incorporating consideration of market risks--exchange rate, interest rate, and equity price risks--into risk-based capital standards for banks.  This paper shows that the separate and seemingly different proposed approaches to the three sources of risk are consistent with one another, reflecting a single unifying theme.  That theme is the measurement of risk through a weighting of two different measures of portfolio size, the gross position and the net position.  A simple theoretical model demonstrates that such an approach can be viewed as a simple (specifically, an affine) approximation to a portfolio variance calculation based on the full variance-covariance matrix of market returns, and thus provides a reasonable basis for a practical approach to capital standards.  An empirical test of one part of the framework, the proposal for exchange rate risk, shows that the approximation may be very accurate:  the proposed Basle approach captures over 95 percent of the variation in foreign exchange risk across a sample of banks from the Twelfth Federal Reserve District."
Rule-of-Thumb Behaviour and Monetary Policy,"Amato, Jeffery D., Laubach, Thomas",N/A,50 pages,http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2002/200205/200205pap.pdf,fedgfe:33963:original,"We investigate the implications of rule-of-thumb behaviour on the part of consumers or price setters for optimal monetary policy and simple interest rate rules. The existence of such behaviour leads to endogenous persistence in output and inflation; changes the transmission of shocks to these variables; and alters the policymaker's welfare objective. Our main finding is that highly inertial policy is optimal regardless of what fraction of agents occasionally follow a rule of thumb. We also find that the interest rate rule that implements optimal policy in the purely optimising case, and a first-difference version of Taylor's (1993) rule, have desirable properties in all of the cases we consider. By contrast, the coefficients in other optimised simple rules tend to be extremely sensitive with respect to the fraction of rule-of-thumb behaviour and changes in other parameters of the model."
Falling Oil Prices and Global Saving,"Russo, Patrick, Klitgaard, Thomas",N/A,N/A,https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2015/06/falling-oil-prices-and-global-saving.html,fednls:87039,"The rise in oil prices from near $30 per barrel in 2000 to around $110 per barrel in mid-2014 was a dramatic reallocation of global income to oil producers. So what did oil producers do with this bounty? Trade data show that they spent about half of the increase in total export revenues on imports and the other half to buy foreign assets. The drop in oil prices will unwind this process. Oil-importing countries will gain from lower oil bills, but they will also see a decline in their exports to oil-producing countries and in purchases of their assets by investors in these countries. Indeed, one can make the case that the drop in oil prices, by itself, is putting upward pressure on interest rates as income shifts away from countries that have had a relatively high propensity to save."
Unresolved issues in monetary policy,"Solomon, Anthony M.",N/A,42-47,https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/quarterly_review/75th/75article8.pdf,fednqr:28132,"Solomon held the office of president during a period of notably successful anti-inflationary monetary policy as well as rapid financial innovation and deregulation. In this speech, he discusses monetary strategy  in particular the targeting of monetary aggregates, interest rates, and nominal GNP  in light of trends in inflation and the uncertainties introduced by changing financial markets."
Optimal Inflation Target with Expectations-Driven Liquidity Traps,"Nakata, Taisuke, Coyle, Philip",N/A,31 pages,https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019036pap.pdf,fedgfe:34134:original,"In expectations-driven liquidity traps, a higher inflation target is associated with lower inflation and consumption. As a result, introducing the possibility of expectations-driven liquidity traps to an otherwise standard model lowers the optimal inflation target. Using a calibrated New Keynesian model with an effective lower bound (ELB) constraint on nominal interest rates, we find that even a very small probability of falling into an expectations-driven liquidity trap lowers the optimal inflation target nontrivially. Our analysis provides a reason to be cautious about the argument that central banks should raise their inflation targets in light of a higher likelihood of hitting the ELB."
"Managing a New Policy Framework: Paul Volcker, the St. Louis Fed, and the 1979-82 War on Inflation","Wheelock, David C., Kliesen, Kevin L.",1979,31 pages,https://s3.amazonaws.com/real.stlouisfed.org/wp/2020/2020-022.pdf,fedlwp:88437:original,"In October 1979, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker persuaded his FOMC colleagues to adopt a new policy framework that i) accepted responsibility for controlling inflation and ii) implemented new operating procedures to control the growth of monetary aggregates in an effort to restore price stability. These moves were strongly supported by monetarist-oriented economists, including the leadership and staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The next three years saw inflation peak and then fall sharply, but also two recessions and considerable volatility in interest rates and money supply growth rates. This article reviews the episode through the lens of speeches and FOMC meeting statements of Volcker and St. Louis Fed president Lawrence Roos, and articles by Roos’ staff. The FOMC adopted monetarist principles to establish the Fed’s anti-inflation credibility but Volcker was willing to accept deviations of money growth from the FOMC’s targets, unlike Roos, who viewed the targets as sacrosanct. The FOMC abandoned monetary aggregates in October 1982, but preserved the Fed’s commitment to price stability. The episode illustrates how Volcker used a change in operating procedures to alter policy fundamentally, and later adapt the procedures to changed circumstances without abandoning the foundational features of the policy."
The signaling channel for Federal Reserve bond purchases,"Bauer, Michael D., Rudebusch, Glenn D.",N/A,N/A,http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2011/wp11-21bk.pdf,fedfwp:8657:original,"Previous research has emphasized the portfolio balance effects of Federal Reserve bond purchases, in which a reduced bond supply lowers term premia. In contrast, we find that such purchases have important signaling effects that lower expected future short term interest rates. Our evidence comes from dynamic term structure models that decompose declines in yields following Fed announcements into changes in risk premia and expected short rates. To overcome problems in measuring term premia, we consider unbiased model estimation and restricted risk price estimation. We also characterize the estimation uncertainty regarding the relative importance of the signaling and portfolio balance channels."
Inferring the Shadow Rate from Real Activity,"Skaperdas, Arsenios, Garcia, Benjamin",N/A,47,https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017106pap.pdf,fedgfe:35018:original,We estimate a shadow rate consistent with the paths of time series capturing real activity. This allows us to quantify the real effects of unconventional monetary policy in terms of equivalent short-term interest rate movements. We find that large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance had significant real effects equivalent of up to a four percent reduction in the federal funds rate.
Reaching for Yield,"Haltom, Renee Courtois",N/A,5-8,https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/econ_focus/2013/q3/pdf/federal_reserve.pdf,fedrrf:61770,Are the Fed?s low interest rate policies pushing investors toward risk?
When is the government spending multiplier large?,"Rebelo, Sergio, Christiano, Lawrence J., Eichenbaum, Martin S.",N/A,N/A,http://www.frbatlanta.org/documents/cqer/publicationscq/cqerwp/cqer_wp10-01.pdf,fedacq:33510:original,"We argue that the government spending multiplier can be very large when the nominal interest rate is constant. We focus on a natural case in which the interest rate is constant, which is when the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates binds. For the economies that we consider it is optimal to increase government spending in response to shocks that make the zero bound binding."
Two Illustrations of the Quantity Theory of Money Reloaded,"Gao, Han, Nicolini, Juan Pablo, Kulish, Mariano",N/A,61,https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp774.pdf,fedmwp:89164:original,"In this paper, we review the relationship between inflation rates, nominal interest rates, and rates of growth of monetary aggregates for a large group of OECD countries. We conclude that the low-frequency behavior of these series maintains a close relationship, as predicted by standard quantity theory models. In an estimated model, we show those relationships to be relatively invariant to alternative frictions that can deliver very different high-frequency dynamics. We argue that these relationships are useful for policy design aimed at controlling inflation."
The differential regional effects of monetary policy: evidence from the U.S. States,"Carlino, Gerald A., DeFina, Robert H.",N/A,N/A,https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/1997/wp97-12.pdf,fedpwp:4151:original,"This paper uses time-series techniques to examine whether monetary policy has similar effects across U.S. states during the 1958-92 period. Impulse response functions from estimated structural vector autoregression models reveal differences in state policy responses, which in some cases are substantial. The paper also provides evidence on the reasons for the measured cross-state differential policy responses. The size of a state's response is significantly related to its industry mix, evidence of an interest rate channel for monetary policy. The state-level data offer no support for recently advanced credit-channel theories of the monetary policy transmission mechanism."
Fiscal multipliers under an interest rate peg of deterministic vs. stochastic duration,"Paustian, Matthias, Carlstrom, Charles T., Fuerst, Timothy S.",N/A,21 pages,https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-201235,fedcwp:39658:original,"This paper revisits the size of the fiscal multiplier. The experiment is a fiscal expansion under the assumption of a pegged nominal rate of interest. We demonstrate that a quantitatively important issue is the articulation of the exit from the policy experiment. If the monetary-fiscal expansion is stochastic with a mean duration of T periods, the fiscal multiplier can be unboundedly large. However, if the monetary-fiscal expansion is for a fixed T periods, the multiplier is much smaller. Our explanation rests on a Jensen?s inequality type argument: the deterministic multiplier is convex in duration, and the stochastic multiplier is a weighted average of the deterministic multipliers. The quantitative difference in the two multipliers also arises in a model with capital, and in the baseline nonlinear model. However, the differences between the two is less pronounced in the nonlinear models."
Foreign exchange intervention when interest rates are zero: does the portfolio balance channel matter after all?,"Fatum, Rasmus",N/A,N/A,http://dallasfed.org/assets/documents/institute/wpapers/2010/0057.pdf,feddgw:14447:original,"The Japanese zero-interest rate period provides a \""natural experiment\"" for investigating the effectiveness and transmission channels of sterilized intervention when traditional monetary policy options are constrained. This paper takes advantage of the fact that all interventions in the JPY/USD market during the zero-interest rate period are sterilized sales of JPY and, therefore, none of these interventions can signal a future interest rate decrease. In order to further assess through which transmission channel these interventions work, the analysis integrates official daily Japanese intervention data with a comprehensive set of rumors data that capture interventions of which the market is aware. Market awareness is a necessary condition for intervention to disseminate information and work through channels other than the portfolio balance channel. The results of the time series analysis show that intervention, on average, induces a statistically and economically significant same-day depreciation of the JPY. Market awareness is shown to be unimportant. Consequently, the effects of Japanese interventions during the zero-interest rate period are consistent only with the portfolio balance channel. This is a remarkable finding, demonstrating that sterilized intervention is, in principle, an independent policy instrument."
Money stock control with reserve and interest rate instruments under rational expectations,"Hoehn, James G., McCallum, Bennett T.",N/A,33 pages,https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/research/papers/1982/wp8201.pdf,feddwp:27451:original,N/A
Assessing supervisory scenarios for interest rate risk,"Lopez, Jose A., Christensen, Jens H. E.",N/A,N/A,http://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/el2015-29.pdf,fedfel:1663,"A new proposal by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision for setting the amount of capital banks must hold against potential losses from interest rate risk uses only a few, very stylized scenarios. Analysis shows the proposed scenarios are extremely unlikely to occur. While they may be appropriate for setting bank capital guidelines, they are much less relevant for everyday risk management. Instead, using a modeling framework with a plausible range of interest rate scenarios would be more relevant to help banks manage their interest rate risk."

Some unpleasant properties of loglinearized solutions when the nominal rate is zero,"Waki, Yuichiro, Korber, Lena Mareen, Braun, R. Anton",N/A,69 pages,https://www.atl.frb.org/-/media/Documents/research/publications/wp/2012/wp1205b.pdf?la=en,fedawp:13381:original,"Does fiscal policy have large and qualitatively different effects on the economy when the nominal interest rate is zero? An emerging consensus in the New Keynesian (NK) literature is that the answer to this question is yes. Evidence presented here suggests that the NK model's implications for fiscal policy at the zero bound may not be all that different from its implications for policy away from it. For a range of empirically relevant parameterizations, employment increases when the labor tax rate is cut and the government purchase multiplier is less than 1.05."
Inflation-induced valuation errors in the stock market,"Lansing, Kevin J.",N/A,N/A,http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2004/el2004-30.html,fedfel:2576,"A recent front-page article in the Wall Street Journal documented an increasing tendency among economists to move away from theories of efficient stock market valuation in favor of \\""behavioral\\"" models that emphasize the role of irrational investors (see Hilsenrath 2004). The long-run rate of return on stocks is ultimately determined by the stream of corporate earnings distributions (cash flows) that accrue to shareholders. In assigning prices to stocks, efficient valuation theory says that rational investors should discount real cash flows using real interest rates or discount nominal cash flows using nominal interest rates. Twenty-five years ago, Modigliani and Cohn (1979) put forth the hypothesis that investors may irrationally discount real cash flows using nominal interest rates - a behavioral trait that would lead to inflation-induced valuation errors. This Economic Letter examines some recent research that finds support for the Modigliani-Cohn hypothesis. In particular, studies show that the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 stock index tends to be undervalued during periods of high expected inflation (such as the late 1970s and early 1980s) and overvalued during periods of low expected inflation (such as the late 1990s and early 2000s). This result implies that the long bull market that began in 1982 can be partially attributed to the stock market's shift from a state of undervaluation to one of overvaluation. Going forward, the return on stocks could be influenced by a shift in the opposite direction."

The optimal combination of reserves and interest rate policy requires an increase in liquidity (reserves) a few quarters after the policy rate is set at the effective lower bound. Removal of accommodation requires that quantitative tightening starts before the liftoff of the policy rate. Moreover, the withdrawal of liquidity takes place at a very slow pace relative to the normalization of the policy rate."

Rethinking the implications of monetary policy: How a transactions role for money transforms the predictions of our leading models,"Thomas, Julia K.",N/A,19-28,https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/economy/articles/business-review/2009/q1/brq109_implications-of-monetary-policy.pdf,fedpbr:32185,"Over the past several decades, economists have devoted ever-growing effort to developing economic models to help us understand how changes in interest rates brought about by monetary policy actions affect the production and provision of goods and services in the economy. Although New Keynesian models have broad appeal in explaining how changes in the money stock can affect business activity, these models generate results that are inconsistent with what we know about how interest rates move with policy-induced changes in the money stock. In \\""Rethinking the Implications of Monetary Policy: How a Transactions Role for Money Transforms the Predictions of Our Leading Models,\\"" Julia Thomas argues that by extending the New Keynesian model to reintroduce money's liquidity role, we can resolve some of the remaining divorce between economic theory and the patterns observed in the workings of actual economies."
Comparing Measures of Potential Output,"Shell, Hannah, Owyang, Michael T., Guisinger, Amy Y.",N/A,297-316,https://doi.org/10.20955/r.100.297-316,fedlrv:26168,"One of the goals of stabilization policy is to reduce the output gap?the difference between potential and actual output?during downturns. Potential output, however, is an unobserved variable whose definition can vary. For example, some view potential output as the level of output that can be produced when employment is at the natural rate. Others use trend measures of output to measure potential. We survey some of these measures using both full-sample data (all of the data that would be available through June 2017) and real-time data (the actual data that would have been available at different points in the sample). We construct six different measures of potential: a linear trend, a quadratic trend, the Congressional Budget Office measure, and three filtered trends. We compare these measures across methods and across time. We also use the measures to compute the monetary policy prescription in a standard interest rate rule and find very little difference across methods."

Capital controls during financial crises: the case of Malaysia and Thailand,"Reinhart, Carmen M., Edison, Hali J.",N/A,N/A,http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2000/662/default.htm,fedgif:37072:original,"This study examines the impact capital controls had in Malaysia (1998-1999) and Thailand (1997). We aim to assess the extent to which the capital controls were effective in delivering the outcomes that motivated their imposition. We conclude that in Thailand the controls did not deliver much of what was intended--although, one does not observe the counterfactual. By contrast, in the case of Malaysia the controls did align closely with the priors of what controls are intended to achieve: greater interest rate and exchange rate stability and more policy autonomy."

Aging and the Real Interest Rate in Japan: A Labor Market Channel,"Fujiwara, Ippei, Fujita, Shigeru",N/A,45,https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/2021/wp21-23.pdf,fedpwp:92541:original,"This paper explores a causal link between aging of the labor force and declining trends in the real interest rate in Japan. We develop a search/matching model that features heterogeneous workers with respect to their ages and firm-specific skills. Using the model, we examine the long-run implications of the sharp drop in labor force entry in the 1970s. We show that the changes in the demographic structure induce significant low-frequency movements in per capita consumption growth and the real interest rate. The model suggests that aging of the labor force accounts for 40 percent or more of the declines in the real interest rate observed between the 1980s and 2000s in Japan. We also examine the impacts of other long-term developments such as a slowdown of TFP growth and higher shares of female and non-regular workers."
Debt Flexibility,"Crouzet, Nicolas, Jacobson, Margaret M., Bidder, Rhys M., Siemer, Michael",N/A,64 p.,https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2023076pap.pdf,fedgfe:97440:original,"This paper documents new facts on the modification of bank loans using FR Y-14Q regulatory data on C&I loans.

Cross sectional differences in modifications are substantial and amplified by borrower distress. Relative to single-lender loans, syndicated loans are 1.5 times more likely to be modified and interest rate changes are twice as likely. Our findings call into question whether 1) creditor dispersion makes loan modifications more challenging and 2) relationship lending between banks and small borrowers creates more scope for flexibility when borrower-level conditions change."

Testing the expectations hypothesis: some new evidence for Japan,"Thornton, Daniel L.",N/A,N/A,https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/04/09/Thornton.pdf,fedlrv:24743,"The deregulation of the Japanese financial markets and the adoption of an interest rate policy instrument by the Bank of Japan prompted a number of empirical investigations of the expectation hypothesis (EH) of the term structures of interest rates in Japan. This paper is a continuation of this research. It deviates from the previous work on the EH in Japan in two respects. First, it tests the EH by estimating a general vector autoregression (VAR) of the long-term and short-term rates and testing the restrictions implied by the EH on the VAR using a Lagrange multiplier test. Second, the issue of stationarity of interest rates is considered. The paper not only considers the possibility that Japanese interest rates are nonstationary, but also analyzes the implications of nonstationarity for the EH."
"News, sovereign debt maturity, and default risk","Dvorkin, Maximiliano, Sapriza, Horacio, Sanchez, Juan M., Yurdagul, Emircan",N/A,38 pages,https://s3.amazonaws.com/real.stlouisfed.org/wp/2018/2018-033.pdf,fedlwp:10268:original,"Leading into a debt crisis, interest rate spreads on sovereign debt rise before the economy experiences a decline in productivity, suggesting that news about future economic developments may play an important role in these episodes. In a VAR estimation, a news shock has a larger contemporaneous impact on sovereign credit spreads than a comparable shock to labor productivity. A quantitative model of news and sovereign debt default with endogenous maturity choice generates impulse responses and a variance decomposition similar to the empirical VAR estimates. The dynamics of the economy after a bad news shock share some features of a productivity shock and others of sudden stop events. However, unlike episodes of sudden stops, long-term debt does not shield the country from bad news shocks, and it may even exacerbate default risk. Finally, an increase in the precision of news allows the government to improve its debt maturity management, especially during periods of high stress in credit markets, and thus face lower yield spreads while increasing the amount of debt."
Monetary policy and global equilibria in a production economy,"Wolman, Alexander L., Hursey, Tim",N/A,317-337,https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/RichmondFedOrg/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2010/q4/pdf/wolman.pdf,fedreq:26362,"In linear macroeconomic models, an active Taylor rule for monetary policy can guarantee a locally unique nonexplosive equilibrium. In a series of articles, Benhabib, Schmitt-Groh, and Uribe looked beyond the local dynamics and showed that active Taylor rules could interact with the zero bound on nominal interest rates to generate multiple equilibria, including a steady-state equilibrium with inflation below target. Recently, the persistence of low inflation and low nominal interest rates has brought attention to Benhabib, Schmitt-Groh, and Uribe's work in policy circles. We provide an introduction to this line of research. The specific model used here?Rotemberg price setting in discrete time?fits neatly into the frameworks typically used for applied monetary policy analysis.

The analysis here is based to a great extent on information from the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report) and the Quarterly Report of Credit Card Interest Rates.
The Reversal Interest Rate,"Brunnermeier, Markus K., Abadi, Joseph, Koby, Yann",N/A,42,https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/2022/wp22-28.pdf,fedpwp:94694:original,"The reversal interest rate is the rate at which accommodative monetary policy reverses and
becomes contractionary for lending. We theoretically demonstrate its existence in a macroeconomic model featuring imperfectly 
 competitive banks that face financial frictions. When interest rates are cut too low, further monetary stimulus cuts into banks’ profit margins, depressing their net worth and curtailing their credit supply. Similarly, when interest rates are low for too long, the persistent drag on bank profitability eventually outweighs banks’ initial capital gains, also stifling credit supply. We quantify the importance of this mechanism within a calibrated New Keynesian model."
"Credit card borrowing, delinquency, and personal bankruptcy","Stavins, Joanna",N/A,15-30,http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/neer/neer2000/neer400b.htm,fedbne:41447,"Credit card delinquencies and personal bankruptcy rates increased during the mid 1990s, despite the strength of the U.S. economy. Even though per capita income rose during that period, household borrowing grew at an even faster pace. The rise in revolving debt-mainly credit card loans-was especially noticeable, and the increase in personal bankruptcy rates was also substantial. This article examines the relationship between consumer credit card borrowing, delinquency rates, and personal bankruptcies. The author looks at developments involving borrowers, the demand side, and lenders, the supply side. ; Credit card loans have been extended to higher-risk consumers over time. Using data collected in the 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances, the author examines the effect of credit card borrowing on consumer payments delinquency and the relationship between credit card debt and the increase in bankruptcy rates. She also tests whether credit card lenders face an adverse selection problem, whereby banks making worse credit card offers attract more risky customers and have higher delinquency and charge-off rates than others. She finds that banks that charge higher interest rates and some fees have higher delinquency rates, but not higher charge-off rates. Moreover, banks that charge higher interest rates were found to have higher net revenues from credit card lending than other issuers."
"A New Daily Federal Funds Rate Series and History of the Federal Funds Market, 1928-54","Wheelock, David C., Hanes, Christopher, Anbil, Sriya, Carlson, Mark A.",1928,45-70,https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2021/01/14/full-issue.pdf,fedlrv:90589,"This article describes the origins and development of the federal funds market from its inception in the 1920s to the early 1950s. We present a newly digitized daily data series on the federal funds rate from April 1928 through June 1954. We compare the behavior of the funds rate with other money market interest rates and the Federal Reserve discount rate. Our federal funds rate series will enhance the ability of researchers to study an eventful period in U.S. financial history and better understand how monetary policy was transmitted to banking and financial markets. For the 1920s-30s, our series is the best available measure of the overnight risk-free interest rate, better than the call money rate that many studies have used for this purpose. For the 1940s-50s, our series provides new information about the transition away from wartime interest rate pegs culminating in the 1951 Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord."
Dynamic Pricing of Credit Cards and the Effects of Regulation,"Serfes, Konstantinos, Hong, Suting, Hunt, Robert M.",N/A,52 pages,https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/2018/wp18-23.pdf,fedpwp:4469:original,"We construct a two-period model of revolving credit with asymmetric information and adverse selection.In the second period, lenders exploit an informational advantage with respect to their own customers. Those rents stimulate competition for customers in the first period. The informational advantage the current lender enjoys relative to its competitors determines interest rates, credit supply, and switching behavior. We evaluate the consequences of limiting the repricing of existing balances as implemented by recent legislation. Such restrictions increase deadweight losses and reduce ex ante consumer surplus. The model suggests novel approaches to identify empirically the effects of this law."
Three Challenges to Central Bank Orthodoxy,"Bullard, James B.",N/A,15 pages,https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/Files/PDFs/Bullard/remarks/Bullard-SOMC-2-Oct-2015.pdf,fedlps:33179,"October 2, 2015. In a speech to the Shadow Open Market Committee in New York, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard discussed the orthodox view of current monetary policy, which emphasizes that the FOMC's objectives are close to being met while monetary policy settings remain far from normal, along with three challenges to that view, which relate to strict inflation targeting, low real interest rates and globalization. He concluded that the U.S. economy will likely experience better outcomes if the monetary policy orthodoxy is preserved as the guiding principle."
Federal Reserve control of credit,"Strong, Benjamin",N/A,6-14,https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/quarterly_review/75th/75article3.pdf,fednqr:28127,"In the early days of the Federal Reserve, changes in the discount rate were the principal instrument through which the central bank exercised control over credit conditions. In this -address, Strong explains the use of discount rate changes as a means of controlling the volume of credit and influencing interest rate movements.  He considers criteria for discount rate changes, concluding that in the absence of gold movements under a reestablished gold standard, policy makers have no option but to look to general economic conditions."
