Inflation and real activity with firm-level productivity shocks,"Wolman, Alexander L., Dotsey, Michael, King, Robert G.",N/A,"In the last ten years there has been an explosion of empirical work examining price setting behavior at the micro level. The work has in turn challenged existing macro models that attempt to explain monetary nonneutrality, because these models are generally at odds with much of the micro price data. In response, economists have developed a second generation of sticky-price models that are state dependent and that include both fixed costs of price adjustment and idiosyncratic shocks. Nonetheless, some ambiguity remains about the extent of monetary nonneutrality that can be attributed to costly price adjustment. Our paper takes a step toward eliminating that ambiguity.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/2013/wp13-35.pdf,fedpwp:3805:original

Optimal Inflation Target with Expectations-Driven Liquidity Traps,"Nakata, Taisuke, Coyle, Philip",N/A,"In expectations-driven liquidity traps, a higher inflation target is associated with lower inflation and consumption. As a result, introducing the possibility of expectations-driven liquidity traps to an otherwise standard model lowers the optimal inflation target. Using a calibrated New Keynesian model with an effective lower bound (ELB) constraint on nominal interest rates, we find that even a very small probability of falling into an expectations-driven liquidity trap lowers the optimal inflation target nontrivially. Our analysis provides a reason to be cautious about the argument that central banks should raise their inflation targets in light of a higher likelihood of hitting the ELB.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019036pap.pdf,fedgfe:34134:original
Exchange rate rules in support of disinflation programs in developing countries,"Kamin, Steven B.",N/A,"This paper analyzes how exchange rate policies can best support the sustainability of disinflation programs. Freezing the nominal exchange rate frequently has been recommended as a means of suppressing inertial inflation and accelerating the disinflation process. However, because any resultant real exchange rate appreciation often must be corrected through a subsequent devaluation, targeting the nominal exchange rate may merely postpone inflation rather than eliminate it once-and-for-all. This paper argues that because excessive inflation during any particular period may jeopardize the stabilization program, exchange rate policies should be designed to smooth inflation across all phases of the disinflation experience. Toward that end, an initial devaluation followed by partial indexation of the exchange rate to domestic prices may be useful. The paper then considers how inconsistencies between an exchange rate rule and balance-of-payments viability may lead to \""reserves crises\"". Depending upon the credibility of the government's commitment to stabilization, the devaluation prompted by a reserves crisis could trigger additional inflation sufficient to cause the failure of the disinflation program. These considerations underscore the importance of policies that prevent excessive appreciation of the real exchange rate during the disinflation process.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/1991/402/default.htm,fedgif:37417:original

"Managing a New Policy Framework: Paul Volcker, the St. Louis Fed, and the 1979-82 War on Inflation","Wheelock, David C., Kliesen, Kevin L.",N/A,"In October 1979, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker persuaded his FOMC colleagues to adopt a new policy framework that i) accepted responsibility for controlling inflation and ii) implemented new operating procedures to control the growth of monetary aggregates in an effort to restore price stability. These moves were strongly supported by monetarist-oriented economists, including the leadership and staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The next three years saw inflation peak and then fall sharply, but also two recessions and considerable volatility in interest rates and money supply growth rates. This article reviews the episode through the lens of speeches and FOMC meeting statements of Volcker and St. Louis Fed president Lawrence Roos, and articles by Roosâ€?staff. The FOMC adopted monetarist principles to establish the Fedâ€™s anti-inflation credibility but Volcker was willing to accept deviations of money growth from the FOMCâ€™s targets, unlike Roos, who viewed the targets as sacrosanct. The FOMC abandoned monetary aggregates in October 1982, but preserved the Fedâ€™s commitment to price stability. The episode illustrates how Volcker used a change in operating procedures to alter policy fundamentally, and later adapt the procedures to changed circumstances without abandoning the foundational features of the policy.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/real.stlouisfed.org/wp/2020/2020-022.pdf,fedlwp:88437:original

Inflation Levels and (In)Attention,"Tang, Jenny, Bracha, Anat",N/A,Inflation expectations are key determinants of economic activity and are central to the current policy debate about whether inflation expectations will remain anchored in the face of recent pandemic-related increases in inflation. This paper explores evidence of inattention by constructing two different measures of consumersâ€?inattention and documents greater inattention when inflation is low. This suggests that there is indeed a risk of an acceleration in the increases in inflation expectations if actual inflation remains high.,https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2022/inflation-levels-and-in-attention.aspx,fedbwp:93857:original
Racial Unemployment Gaps and the Disparate Impact of the Inflation Tax,"Baughman, Garth, van Buggenum, Hugo, Ait Lahcen, Mohammed",N/A,"We study the nonlinearities present in a standard monetary labor search model modified to have two groups of workers facing exogenous differences in the job finding and separation rates. We use our setting to study the racial unemployment gap between Black and white workers in the United States. A calibrated version of the model is able to replicate the difference between the two groups both in the level and volatility of unemployment. We show that the racial unemployment gap rises during downturns, and that its reaction to shocks is state-dependent. In particular, following a negative productivity shock, when aggregate unemployment is above average the gap increases by 0.6pp more than when aggregate unemployment is below average. In terms of policy, we study the implications of different inflation regimes on the racial unemployment gap. Higher trend inflation increases both the level of the racial unemployment gap and the magnitude of its response to shocks.",https://www.minneapolisfed.org/institute/working-papers-institute/iwp73.pdf,fedmoi:96260:original

Shoe-leather costs of inflation and policy credibility,"Pakko, Michael R.",N/A,"Inflation can cause costly misallocations of resources as consumers seek to protect the purchasing power of their nominal assets. In this article, Michael R. Pakko discusses the nature of these distortions - known as \\""shoe-leather\\"" costs - in a model where the demand for money is motivated by a \\""shopping-time\\"" constraint. While the estimates of the shoe-leather costs of long-run inflation (implied by this model) are generally consistent with previous studies, the article goes on to show that the transition between inflation rates can involve dynamics that alter the nature of these welfare effects. Specifically, the benefits of a disinflation policy are mitigated by the gradual adjustment of the economy in response to a lower inflation rate. This transition can be particularly protracted when there is uncertainty about the credibility of the disinflation policy.",https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/98/11/9811mp.pdf,fedlrv:25737
Inflation-induced valuation errors in the stock market,"Lansing, Kevin J.",N/A,"A recent front-page article in the Wall Street Journal documented an increasing tendency among economists to move away from theories of efficient stock market valuation in favor of \\""behavioral\\"" models that emphasize the role of irrational investors (see Hilsenrath 2004). The long-run rate of return on stocks is ultimately determined by the stream of corporate earnings distributions (cash flows) that accrue to shareholders. In assigning prices to stocks, efficient valuation theory says that rational investors should discount real cash flows using real interest rates or discount nominal cash flows using nominal interest rates. Twenty-five years ago, Modigliani and Cohn (1979) put forth the hypothesis that investors may irrationally discount real cash flows using nominal interest rates - a behavioral trait that would lead to inflation-induced valuation errors. This Economic Letter examines some recent research that finds support for the Modigliani-Cohn hypothesis. In particular, studies show that the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 stock index tends to be undervalued during periods of high expected inflation (such as the late 1970s and early 1980s) and overvalued during periods of low expected inflation (such as the late 1990s and early 2000s). This result implies that the long bull market that began in 1982 can be partially attributed to the stock market's shift from a state of undervaluation to one of overvaluation. Going forward, the return on stocks could be influenced by a shift in the opposite direction.",http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2004/el2004-30.html,fedfel:2576

Drivers of Inflation: The New York Fed DSGE Modelâ€™s Perspective,"Tambalotti, Andrea, Gleich, Aidan, Goyal, Shlok, Del Negro, Marco, Johnson, Alissa",N/A,"After a sharp decline in the first few months of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation rebounded in the second half of 2020 and surged through 2021. This post analyzes the drivers of these developments through the lens of the New York Fed DSGE model. Its main finding is that the recent rise in inflation is mostly accounted for by a large cost-push shock that occurred in the second quarter of 2021 and whose inflationary effects persist today. Based on the modelâ€™s reading of historical data, this shock is expected to fade gradually over the course of 2022, returning quarterly inflation to close to 2 percent only in mid-2023.",https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2022/03/drivers-of-inflation-the-new-york-fed-dsge-models-perspective/,fednls:93778
"The relationship between expected inflation, disagreement, and uncertainty: evidence from matched point and density forecasts","Rich, Robert W., Tracy, Joseph",N/A,"This paper examines matched point and density forecasts of inflation from the Survey of Professional Forecasters to analyze the relationship between expected inflation, disagreement, and uncertainty. We extend previous studies through our data construction and estimation methodology. Specifically, we derive measures of disagreement and uncertainty by using a decomposition proposed in earlier research by Wallis and by applying the concept of entropy from information theory. We also undertake the empirical analysis within a seemingly unrelated regression framework. Our results offer mixed support for the propositions that disagreement is a useful proxy for uncertainty and that increases in expected inflation are accompanied by heightened inflation uncertainty. However, we document a robust, quantitatively and statistically significant positive association between disagreement and expected inflation.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr253.html,fednsr:12316

K-core inflation,"Wolman, Alexander L.",N/A,"K-core inflation is a new class of underlying inflation measures. The two most popular measures of underlying inflation are core inflation and trimmed mean inflation. The former removes fixed categories of goods and services (food and energy) from the inflation calculation, and the latter removes fixed percentiles of the weighted distribution of price changes. In contrast, k-core inflation specifies a size of relative price change to be removed from the inflation calculation. Thus, the categories and percentiles to be removed vary with each period?s distribution of relative price changes.",https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/RichmondFedOrg/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2011/q4/pdf/wolman.pdf,fedreq:26409
Does money matter in inflation forecasting?,"Jones, Barry E., Anderson, Richard G., Kendall, Graham, Tepper, Jonathan, Binner, Jane M., Tino, Peter",N/A,"This paper provides the most fully comprehensive evidence to date on whether or not monetary aggregates are valuable for forecasting US inflation in the early to mid 2000s. We explore a wide range of different definitions of money, including different methods of aggregation and different collections of included monetary assets. In our forecasting experiment we use two non-linear techniques, namely, recurrent neural networks and kernel recursive least squares regression - techniques that are new to macroeconomics. Recurrent neural networks operate with potentially unbounded input memory, while the kernel regression technique is a finite memory predictor. The two methodologies compete to find the best fitting US inflation forecasting models and are then compared to forecasts from a naive random walk model. The best models were non-linear autoregressive models based on kernel methods. Our findings do not provide much support for the usefulness of monetary aggregates in forecasting inflation.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/real.stlouisfed.org/wp/2009/2009-030.pdf,fedlwp:10440:original
