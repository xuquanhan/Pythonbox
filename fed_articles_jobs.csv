Assessing the macroeconomic impact of bank intermediation shocks: a structural approach,"Zha, Tao, Chen, Kaiji",N/A,"We take a structural approach to assessing the empirical importance of shocks to the supply of bank-intermediated credit in affecting macroeconomic fluctuations. First, we develop a theoretical model to show how credit supply shocks can be transmitted into disruptions in the production economy. Second, we use the unique micro-banking data to identify and support the model's key mechanism. Third, we find that the output effect of credit supply shocks is not only economically and statistically significant but also consistent with the vector autogression evidence. Our mode estimation indicates that a negative one-standard-deviation shock to credit supply generates a loss of output by 1 percent.",https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/Documents/research/publications/wp/2015/08.pdf?la=en,fedawp:13426:original

"Discussion of Preston, \""Learning about monetary policy rules when long-horizon expectations matter\""","Honkapohja, Seppo",N/A,"The design of interest rate rules for conducting monetary policy have recently been examined for two key concerns. The first issue is determinacy of equilibria. Indeterminacy (multiplicity of stationary rational expectations equilibria) is a concern in models of monopolistic competition and price stickiness are currently a popular framework for the study of monetary policy. The second issue is stability of equilibria under adaptive learning.

"Economic distress and resurgence in U.S. central cities: concepts, causes, and policy levers","Munoz, Ana Patricia, Kodrzycki, Yolanda",N/A,"This paper provides a review of the literature on U.S. central city growth and distress during the second half of the twentieth century. It finds that city growth tended to be higher in metropolitan areas with favorable weather, higher growth, and greater human capital, while distress was strongly correlated with city-level manufacturing legacy. The article affirms that distress has been highly persistent, but that some cities have achieved resurgence through a combination of strong leadership, collaboration across sectors and institutions, clear and broad-based strategies, and significant infrastructure investments. Finally, the article explores measurement issues by comparing two methodologies used to identify poorly performing central cities: comparisons across a comprehensive national cross-section of cities and comparisons within smaller samples of similar cities. It finds that these approaches have produced similar assessments of a city?s status, except in some cases where the city?s progress has been uneven across time or with respect to alternative criteria.",http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/ppdp/2013/ppdp1303.htm,fedbpp:10855

Implications of structural changes in the U.S. economy for pricing behavior and inflation dynamics,"Willis, Jonathan L.",N/A,"Some key features of the behavior of inflation in the United States appear to have changed in the past 20 years, with potentially important implications for forecasters and policymakers. Recent studies have provided evidence of a decline in both the variability and persistence of inflation. ; Such shifts in the behavior or dynamics of inflation would necessitate changes in the economic relationships used by policymakers and economists to assess current conditions, forecast key economic indicators, and determine the implications of policy changes for future economic activity. ; Willis examines how structural changes in the economy over the past two decades may have affected the price-setting behavior of firms and, in turn, the behavior of aggregate inflation.

Peas in a pod? Comparing the U.S. and Danish mortgage finance systems,"Vickery, James, Berg, Jesper, Nielsen, Morten Bækmand",N/A,"Like the United States, Denmark relies heavily on capital markets for funding residential mortgages, and its covered bond market bears a number of similarities to U.S. agency securitization. This article describes the key features of the Danish mortgage finance system and compares and contrasts them with those of the U.S. system. In addition, it highlights characteristics of the Danish model that may be of interest as the United States considers further mortgage finance reform. In particular, the Danish system includes features that mitigate refinancing frictions during periods of falling home prices, and it offers borrowers the option to repurchase their mortgage at the market price, mitigating ?lock-in? effects. Danish mortgage intermediaries also have high capital ratios relative to their risk exposures, a characteristic that contributes to the stability of the Danish market.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/epr/2018/epr_2018_us-danish-mortgage-finance_berg.pdf,fednep:20044

Medicare and Financial Health across the United States,"Goldsmith-Pinkham, Paul, Pinkovskiy, Maxim L., Wallace, Jacob",N/A,"Consumer financial strain varies enormously across the United States. One pernicious source of financial strain is debt in collections—debt that is more than 120 days past due and that has been sold to a collections agency. In Massachusetts, the average person has less than $100 in collections debt, while in Texas, the average person has more than $300. In this post, we discuss our recent staff report that exploits the fact that virtually all Americans are universally covered by Medicare at 65 to show that health insurance not only improves financial health on average, but also is a major explanation for the heterogeneity in financial strain across the country. We find that Medicare affects different parts of the United States differently and plays a particularly important role in improving financial health in the least advantaged areas.",https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2020/07/medicare-and-financial-health-across-the-united-states.html,fednls:88331
Flood Risk and Firm Location Decisions in the Fed’s Second District,"Hannaoui, Oliver Zain, Santos, João A.

According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), 99 percent of U.S. counties have been impacted by a flooding event since 1999. As the frequency of flood events continues to increase, the number of people, buildings, and agriculture exposed to flood risk is only likely to grow. As a previous post points out, measuring the geographical accuracy of such risk is important and may impact bank lending. In this post, we focus on the distribution of flood risk within the Federal Reserve’s Second District and examine its effect on establishment location decisions over the last two decades.",https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2023/11/flood-risk-and-firm-location-decisions-in-the-feds-second-district/,fednls:97304

The impact of housing markets on consumer debt: credit report evidence from 1999 to 2012,"Zafar, Basit, Stein, Sarah, Brown, Meta",N/A,"We investigate the impact of large swings in the housing market on nonmortgage borrowing, including student, credit card, auto, and home equity debts. For this purpose, we use CoreLogic geographic house price variation, matched with rich data on consumer liabilities from the Equifax-sourced FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel. The length and timing of our panel allow us to study the consumer debt portfolio response to house price changes during a boom-and-bust cycle of historic magnitude as well as during more ordinary times. In first-differenced instrumental variables estimation, we find that during 1999-2001, homeowners substituted out of nonhousing (largely credit card) debt and into home equity-based debt at a nearly dollar-for-dollar rate in response to house price increases. During the housing boom of 2002-06, however, homeowners abandoned the practice of substituting into less costly debt as equity grew, and instead increased obligations across the board. From 2007-12, sample homeowners experienced a 23 percent average house price decline, and withdrew from home equity debt without adding to non-housing debt. We observe substantial heterogeneity in this pattern: Substitution in both 1999-2001 and 2007-12 ranges from 50 cents to more than dollar-for-dollar for older and prime borrowers, while the decidedly nonprime borrow more modestly, show less evidence of substitution, and shed large amounts of all types of debt from 2007-12. Finally, difference-in-differences and FD-IV estimates are consistent with both 1) a 2012 relative debt overhang of at least $1,800 on average, despite little remaining home equity advantage, for homeowners who experienced a more pronounced boom-and-bust cycle and 2) little substitution out of home equity debt into student loans in response to recent house price declines.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr617.html,fednsr:12824

Resolving the puzzle of the underissuance of national bank notes,"Mason, Joseph R., Calomiris, Charles W.",N/A,"The puzzle of underissuance of national bank notes disappears when one disaggregates data, takes account of regulatory limits, and considers differences in opportunity costs. Banks with poor lending opportunities maximized their issuance. Other banks chose to limit issuance. Redemption costs do not explain cross-sectional variation in issuance, and the observed relationship between note issuance and excess reserves is inconsistent with the redemption risk hypothesis of underissuance. National banks did not enter primarily to issue national bank notes, and a ?pure arbitrage? strategy of chartering a national bank only to issue national bank notes would not have been profitable. Indeed, new entrants issued less while banks exiting were often maximum issuers. Economies of scope between note issuing and deposit banking included shared overhead costs and the ability to reduce costs of mandatory minimum reserve and capital requirements.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/2005/wp05-19.pdf,fedpwp:4018:original
A Likelihood-Based Comparison of Macro Asset Pricing Models,"Wasyk, Rebecca, Winkler, Fabian, Chen, Andrew Y.",N/A,"We estimate asset pricing models with multiple risks: long-run growth, long-run volatility, habit, and a residual. The Bayesian estimation accounts for the entire likelihood of consumption, dividends, and the price-dividend ratio. We find that the residual represents at least 80% of the variance of the price-dividend ratio. Moreover, the residual tracks most recognizable features of stock market history such as the 1990's boom and bust. Long run risks and habit contribute primarily in crises. The dominance of the residual comes from the low correlation between asset prices and consumption growth moments. We discuss theories which are consistent with our results.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017024pap.pdf,fedgfe:34008:original

We analytically compare expectations-driven stagnation to a secular stagnation episode and find contrasting policy implications for changes in government spending, supply shocks and neo-Fisherian policies. On the other hand, a minimum wage policy is expansionary and robust to the source of stagnation. Using Bayesian methods, we estimate a DSGE model that can accommodate two competing hypotheses of long-run stagnation in Japan.

Benefits and spillovers of greater competition in Europe: a macroeconomic assessment,"Bayoumi, Tamim, Pesenti, Paolo, Laxton, Douglas",N/A,"Using a general-equilibrium simulation model featuring nominal rigidities and monopolistic competition in product and labor markets, this paper estimates the macroeconomic benefits and international spillovers of an increase in competition. After calibrating the model to the euro area vs. the rest of the industrial world, the paper draws three conclusions. First, greater competition produces large effects on macroeconomic performance, as measured by standard indicators. In particular, we show that differences in competition can account for over half of the current gap in GDP per capita between the euro area and the US. Second, it may improve macroeconomic management by increasing the responsiveness of wages and prices to market conditions. Third, greater competition can generate positive spillovers to the rest of the world through its impact on the terms of trade.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2004/803/default.htm,fedgif:36560:original

Investor Sentiment and the (Discretionary) Accrual-return Relation,"Liu, Qi, Jiang, Jiajun, Sun, Bo",N/A,"Discretionary accruals are positively associated with stock returns at the aggregate level but negatively so in the cross section. Using Baker-Wurgler investor sentiment index, we find that a significant presence of sentiment-driven investors is important in accounting for both patterns. We document that the aggregate relation is only prominent during periods of high investor sentiment. Similarly, the cross-section relation is considerably stronger in high-sentiment periods in both economic magnitude and statistical significance. We then embed investor sentiment into a stylized model of earnings management, and illustrate that a positive (negative) relationship between stock returns and earnings management can endogenously emerge in the aggregate (cross section). Our analysis suggests that the (discretionary) accrual-return relation at both the aggregate and firm levels at least partially reflects mispricing that is related to market-wide investor sentiment.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/files/ifdp1300.pdf,fedgif:88770:original

This paper analyzes four possible explanations for why Chile recovered much faster than did Mexico. Comparing data from the two countries allows us to rule out a monetarist explanation, an explanation based on falls in real wages and real exchange rates, and a debt overhang explanation. Using growth accounting, a calibrated growth model, and economic theory, we conclude that the crucial difference between the two countries was the earlier policy reforms in Chile that generated faster productivity growth.

This fact is a puzzle under the commonly held view that metallic coins are commodity money and exchange by weight. An existing explanation is that debased coins were used to reduce the real burden of nominally denominated debts. This explanation is logically flawed: nothing prevents agents from renegotiating contracts and avoid incurring minting costs.

Deferred cash compensation: enhancing stability in the financial services industry,"Mehran, Hamid, Tracy, Joseph",N/A,"Employees in financial firms are compensated for creating value for the firm, but firms themselves also serve a public interest. This tension can lead to issues that could impose a significant risk to the firm and the public. The authors describe three channels through which deferred cash compensation can mitigate such risk: by promoting a conservative approach to risk, by inducing internal monitoring, and by creating a liquidity buffer. Ultimately, the net contribution of deferred cash pay to financial stability is the sum of the effects of the three channels. The authors argue that a deferred cash program can be designed to limit interference with labor mobility. Further, they underscore that such a scheme for banks is not punitive, particularly in a world of no bailouts. They offer a baseline conservative estimate for the size of the buffer for the largest U.S. banks. Finally, they discuss the potential effects of deferred cash pay on information production and sharing with regulators, and the intersection of deferred cash and enforcement.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/epr/2016/epr_2016_deferred-cash-comp_mehran,fednep:20101
Stress Test Success and Bank Opacity,"Morgan, Donald P.",N/A,"In contemplating the recent financial panic, it is easy to get lost in the weeds of repo markets and asset-backed securities and lose sight of the fact that, at the fundamental level, the panic was about inadequate information. Investors were uncertain about what particular assets were worth, and they were uncertain about which banks were exposed to those assets and to what degree. They were also uncertain about how the government would handle undercapitalized banks. It was against this background that the Treasury announced in February 2009 that the nineteen largest U.S. bank holding companies would be subject to an unprecedented stress test to determine if the banks had sufficient capital to survive and maintain lending in the event of a worse-than-expected recession. In this post, I discuss a recent New York Fed staff report that I wrote with Stavros Peristiani and Vanessa Savino that provides evidence that the stress test supplied new information to the market, and thus may have helped quell the panic.",https://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2011/05/stress-test-success-and-bank-opacity.html,fednls:86748

Three sources for obtaining information about such expectations are available. The first is extrapolation from historical data. The second consists of surveys of expectations. The third are expectations drawn from financial market prices, often referred to as market expectations. The last are usually considered to be model-based expectations, because, generally, a model is needed to reliably extract expectations from current prices.

This paper develops a framework for comparing auctions to the more traditional negotiated sales. The model showsthat auctions will sell property at a discount because a quick sale results in a poorer \""match\"" between house and buyer, on average, than could be obtained by waiting longer for a buyer. Furthermore, the model predicts that auction discounts should be larger in a down market with high vacancies, and in a smaller market with fewer buyers and sellers, when there is a larger difference between houses. Finally, the auction discount is smaller when property is more homogeneous, because the match between buyer and house matters less in the final price.

The varying effects of predatory lending laws on high-cost mortgage applications,"Pennington-Cross, Anthony, Ho, Giang",N/A,"Federal, state, and local predatory lending laws are designed to restrict and in some cases prohibit certain types of high-cost mortgage credit in the subprime market. Empirical evidence using the spatial variation in these laws shows that the aggregate flow of high-cost mortgage credit can increase, decrease, or be unchanged after these laws are enacted. Although it may seem counterintuitive to find that a law that prohibits lending could be associated with more lending, it is hypothesized that a law may reduce the cost of sorting honest loans from dishonest loans and lessen borrowers' fears of predation, thus stimulating the high-cost mortgage market.",https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/07/01/HoPennCross.pdf,fedlrv:25611

"Mimicking portfolios, economic risk premia, and tests of multi-beta models","Robotti, Cesare, Balduzzi, Pierluigi",N/A,"This paper considers two alternative formulations of the linear factor model (LFM) with nontraded factors. The first formulation is the traditional LFM, where the estimation of risk premia and alphas is performed by means of a cross-sectional regression of average returns on betas. The second formulation (LFM*) replaces the factors with their projections on the span of excess returns. This formulation requires only time-series regressions for the estimation of risk premia and alphas. We compare the theoretical properties of the two approaches and study the small-sample properties of estimates and test statistics. Our results show that when estimating risk premia and testing multi-beta models, the LFM* formulation should be considered in addition to, or even instead of, the more traditional LFM formulation.",https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/wp/2005/wp0504.pdf,fedawp:13944:original
The Local Origins of Business Formation,"Dunne, Timothy, Haltiwanger, John, Dinlersoz, Emin M., Penciakova, Veronika",N/A,"What locations generate more business ideas, and where are ideas more likely to turn into businesses? Using comprehensive administrative data on business applications, we analyze the spatial disparity in the creation of business ideas and the formation of new employer startups from these ideas. Startups per capita exhibit enormous variation across granular units of geography. We decompose this variation into variation in ideas per capita and in their rate of transition to startups, and we find that both components matter. Observable local demographic, economic, financial, and business conditions account for a significant fraction of the variation in startups per capita—and more so for the variation in ideas per capita than in transition rate. Income, education, age, and foreign-born share are generally strong positive correlates of both idea generation and transition. Overall, the relationship of local conditions with ideas differs from that with transition rate in magnitude and, sometimes, in sign: certain conditions (notably, the African American share of the population) are positively associated with ideas but negatively with transition rates. We also find a close correspondence between the actual rank of locations in terms of startups per capita and the predicted rank based only on observable local conditions—a result useful for characterizing locations with high startup activity.",https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/wp/2023/08/02/09--local-origins-of-business-formation.pdf,fedawp:96614:original

Has the effect of monetary policy announcements on asset prices changed?,"Doh, Taeyoung, Connolly, Michael",N/A,"The Federal Reserve increasingly has relied on forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate to implement monetary policy since the federal funds target rate reached its effective lower bound. The enhanced use of forward policy guidance has drawn attention to any change in its influence on the real economy. Changes in policy guidance affect the private sector?s expectations about the future path of the federal funds rate and, in turn, affect bond yields, stock prices and asset values. Changes in asset values influence real activity through their effects on spending by consumers and businesses. Doh and Connolly find a weakened response by stock prices and bond yields to the increased use of policy guidance since the recent financial crisis. Longer-term bond yields became less responsive because a prolonged period of the low interest rate reduced the variability of medium-term expectations; stock prices became less responsive because investors revised down their economic outlook in response to some announcements of a more accommodative monetary policy.",https://www.kansascityfed.org/documents/1095/2013-Has%20The%20Effect%20of%20Monetary%20Policy%20Announcements%20On%20Asset%20Prices%20Changed%3F.pdf,fedker:31339
Will the wild ride for U.S. agriculture continue in 1997?,"Drabenstott, Mark",N/A,"U.S. agriculture formally entered a new era in April 1996 when a new seven-year farm bill was signed into law overturning 60 years of commodity programs. The new bill set agriculture on a new course where markets, not government programs, will determine agriculture's products and its bottom line. The new path was underscored by one of the wildest years in commodity markets in recent memory. Grain prices soared to new heights, while cattle prices sank to new lows. The market swings pointed to the variations in income that agriculture may experience under the new farm bill. Nevertheless, a new record for U.S. agricultural exports also suggested that the market trend for the industry is decidedly up.> For most of U.S. agriculture the year just past was a good one. Crop producers had a banner year, with high prices and the first year of transition payments under the new farm bill. In contrast, livestock growers had a difficult time due to high feed costs, with problems especially pronounced for cattle producers. In the end, the boost to crop producers prevailed, and U.S. farm income was up sharply, while increasing much less in the district due to the cattle situation.> Drabenstott reviews the year just past for U.S. agriculture and suggests the year ahead should be another good one, though probably not as good as 1996. A bigger than expected 1996 harvest will weigh on crop markets, keeping prices below 1996 levels. Still, the 1997 harvest will have a major bearing on prices since grain stocks remain low by historical standards. The lower crop prices will help fatten livestock profits, and the livestock industry could have its best year in the past four. Overall, farm income will probably decline in the nation but remain relatively strong. In the district, where cattle profits are particularly important, farm income will probably rise. With export markets staying strong and commodity markets more settled, agriculture will generally have smooth sailing in the new market era.",https://www.kansascityfed.org/documents/1435/1997-Will%20the%20Wild%20Ride%20for%20U.S.%20Agriculture%20Continue%20in%201997%3F.pdf,fedker:31401

However, there are far more industries in which technological progress significantly increases hours.

Overborrowing and systemic externalities in the business cycle,"Bianchi, Javier",N/A,"Credit constraints that link a private agent?s debt to market-determined prices embody a credit externality that drives a wedge between competitive and constrained socially optimal equilibria, inducing private agents to overborrow. The externality arises because agents fail to internalize the debt-deflation effects of additional borrowing when negative income shocks trigger the credit constraint. We quantify the effects of this inefficiency in a two-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model of a small open economy calibrated to emerging markets. The credit externality increases the probability of financial crises by a factor of seven and causes the maximum drop in consumption to increase by 10 percentage points.",https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/wp/2009/wp0924.pdf,fedawp:13447:original

Stripdowns and bankruptcy: lessons from agricultural bankruptcy reform,"Fitzpatrick, Thomas J., Thomson, James B.",N/A,"One type of financial reform being proposed to deal with the aftermath of the housing crisis is allowing bankruptcy judges the authority to modify residential mortgages in a way referred to as a stripdown. The reform is seen by some as a partial solution to the rise in foreclosures and as a Pandora?s box by others. But the debate is not new one. The 1980s farm foreclosure crisis sparked similar proposals and concerns. Congress decided to enact legislation that contained a stripdown provision, resulting in the creation of Chapter 12 in the bankruptcy code. The effects of Chapter 12 stripdown authority after its enactment shed light on the efficacy of allowing bankruptcy judges similar authority for housing loans.",https://www.clevelandfed.org/publications/economic-commentary/2010/ec-201009-stripdowns-and-bankruptcy-lessons-from-agricultural-bankruptcy-reform,fedcec:29585

We find that increases in the cost of low-wage labor, via minimum wage hikes, lead to relative employment declines at cognitively routine occupations but not manually-routine or non-routine low-wage occupations. This suggests that low-wage routine cognitive tasks are susceptible to technological substitution.

Monetary policy regime switches and macroeconomic dynamic,"Foerster, Andrew T.",N/A,"This paper investigates how different monetary policy regime switching types impact macroeconomic dynamics. Policy switches that either affect the inflation target or the response to inflation deviations from target lead to different determinacy regions and different output, inflation, and interest rate distributions. With regime switching, the standard Taylor Principle breaks down in multiple ways; satisfying the Principle period-by-period is neither necessary nor sufficient for determinacy. Switching inflation targets primarily affects the economy's level, whereas switching inflation responses affects the variance. Even in periods with a fixed monetary policy rule, expectations of future policy switches produce different outcomes depending upon the switching type. Monetary authorities with given inflation objectives need to adjust their policy parameters to counteract expectations of future policy switches.",https://www.kansascityfed.org/documents/7707/rwp13-04.pdf,fedkrw:40974:original

How do data revisions affect the evaluation and conduct of monetary policy?,"Kozicki, Sharon",N/A,"Many economic data series are revised as more comprehensive information becomes available and as methodologies improve. Even the latest available data are subject to uncertainty, and at some point historical data may be replaced by more accurately measured observations. Because monetary policy decisions are made with an eye to the state of the economy, data uncertainty complicates the evaluation and conduct of monetary policy. ; Kozicki focuses on revisions to data that policymakers often examine when assessing monetary policy options. While other studies have looked at the impact of data revisions on monetary policy, this article is the first to examine the policy implications of revisions in two widely used benchmarks of resource utilization?the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates of potential output and the natural rate of unemployment.

Pandemic-Era Inflation Drivers and Global Spillovers,"Silva, Alvaro, Kalemli-Özcan, Ṣebnem, Yildirim, Muhammed A., di Giovanni, Julian",N/A,"We estimate a multi-country, multi-sector New Keynesian model to quantify the drivers of domestic inflation during 2020–23 in several countries, including the United States. The model matches observed inflation together with sector-level prices and wages. We further measure the relative importance of different types of shocks on inflation across countries over time. The key mechanism, the international transmission of demand, supply and energy shocks through global linkages helps us to match the behavior of the USD/EUR exchange rate. The quantification exercise yields four key findings. First, negative supply shocks to factors of production, labor and intermediate inputs, initially sparked inflation in 2020-21. Global supply chains and complementarities in production played an amplification role in this initial phase. Second, positive aggregate demand shocks, due to stimulative policies, widened demand-supply imbalances, amplifying inflation further during 2021-22. Third, the reallocation of consumption between goods and service sectors, a relative sector-level demand shock, played a role in transmitting these imbalances across countries through the global trade and production network. Fourth, global energy shocks have differential impacts on the U.S. relative to other countries’ inflation rates. Further, complementarities between energy and other inputs to production play a particularly important role in the quantitative impact of these shocks on inflation.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr1080.pdf,fednsr:97350

Over a 10-year period, 426 mechanic’s liens were filed against 398 single-family properties, which is less than 0.1 percent of single-family properties in Philadelphia. The lien properties in our data set tend to be more expensive, newer, and larger than non-lien properties. About 80 percent of mechanic’s liens are filed by general contractors, with the remainder pursued by a subcontractor. Notably, a 2014 change in Pennsylvania law made it less advantageous for subcontractors to file liens, and we find a concomitant decline in the share of liens filed by subcontractors.

"House prices, credit growth, and excess volatility: implications for monetary and macroprudential policy","Lansing, Kevin J., Mendicino, Caterina, Gelain, Paolo",N/A,"Progress on the question of whether policymakers should respond directly to financial variables requires a realistic economic model that captures the links between asset prices, credit expansion, and real economic activity. Standard DSGE models with fully-rational expectations have difficulty producing large swings in house prices and household debt that resemble the patterns observed in many developed countries over the past decade. We introduce excess volatility into an otherwise standard DSGE model by allowing a fraction of households to depart from fully-rational expectations. Specifically, we show that the introduction of simple moving-average forecast rules for a subset of households can significantly magnify the volatility and persistence of house prices and household debt relative to otherwise similar model with fully-rational expectations. We evaluate various policy actions that might be used to dampen the resulting excess volatility, including a direct response to house price growth or credit growth in the central bank?s interest rate rule, the imposition of more restrictive loan-to-value ratios, and the use of a modified collateral constraint that takes into account the borrower?s loan-to-income ratio. Of these, we find that a loan-to-income constraint is the most effective tool for dampening overall excess volatility in the model economy. We find that while an interest-rate response to house price growth or credit growth can stabilize some economic variables, it can significantly magnify the volatility of others, particularly inflation.",http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2012/wp12-11bk.pdf,fedfwp:8561:original
How does competition impact bank risk-taking?,"Jimenez, Gabriel, Saurina, Jesus, Lopez, Jose A.",N/A,"A common assumption in the academic literature and in the actual supervision of banking systems worldwide is that franchise value plays a key role in limiting bank risk-taking. As the underlying source of franchise value is assumed to be market power, reduced competition has been considered to promote banking stability. Boyd and De Nicolo (2005) propose an alternative view where concentration in the loan market could lead to increased borrower debt loads and a corresponding increase in loan defaults that undermine bank stability. Martinez-Miera and Repullo (2007) encompass both approaches by proposing a nonlinear relationship between competition and bank risk-taking. Using unique datasets for the Spanish banking system, we examine the empirical nature of that relationship. After controlling for macroeconomic conditions and bank characteristics, we find that standard measures of market concentration do not affect the ratio of non-performing commercial loans (NPL), our measure of bank risk. However, using Lerner indexes based on bank-specific interest rates, we find a negative relationship between loan market power and bank risk. This result provides evidence in favor of the franchise value paradigm.",http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2007/wp07-23bk.pdf,fedfwp:8619:original
Bank Profitability and Debit Card Interchange Regulation: Bank Responses to the Durbin Amendment,"Vojtech, Cindy M., Kay, Benjamin S., Manuszak, Mark D.",N/A,"The Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 alters the competitive structure of the debit card payment processing industry and caps debit card interchange fees for banks with over $10 billion in assets. Market participants predicted that debit card issuers would offset the reduction in debit interchange revenue by increases in customer account fees. Some participants also predicted that banks would cut costs in response to the law by reducing staff and shutting down branches. Using a difference-in-differences testing strategy, we show that debit interchange fee income fell for treated banks, leading to a fall in noninterest income. We also find that banks only partially offset this loss with deposit fees. We document that treated banks neither reduced costs nor strategically avoided the $10 billion threshold.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2014/files/201477pap.pdf,fedgfe:34042:original
Monetary Policy 101: A Primer on the Fed's Changing Approach to Policy Implementation,"Meade, Ellen E., Weinbach, Gretchen C., Ihrig, Jane E.",N/A,"The Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy in order to achieve its statutory mandate of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates as prescribed by the Congress and laid out in the Federal Reserve Act. For many years prior to the financial crisis, the FOMC set a target for the federal funds rate and achieved that target through purchases and sales of securities in the open market. In the aftermath of the financial crisis, with a superabundant level of reserve balances in the banking system having been created as a result of the Federal Reserve's large scale asset purchase programs, this approach to implementing monetary policy will no longer work. This paper provides a primer on the Fed's implementation of monetary policy. We use the standard textbook model to illustrate why the approach used by the Federal Reserve before the financial crisis to keep the federal funds rate near the FOMC's target will not work in current circumst ances, and explain the approach that the Committee intends to use instead when it decides to begin raising short-term interest rates.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2015/files/2015047pap.pdf,fedgfe:34336:original
Bank regulation under fire sale externalities,"Kara, Gazi I., Ozsoy, S. Mehmet",N/A,"This paper examines the optimal design of and interaction between capital and liquidity regulations in a model characterized by fire sale externalities. In the model, banks can insure against potential liquidity shocks by hoarding sufficient precautionary liquid assets. However, it is never optimal to fully insure, so realized liquidity shocks trigger an asset fire sale. Banks, not internalizing the fire sale externality, overinvest in the risky asset and underinvest in the liquid asset in the unregulated competitive equilibrium. Capital requirements can lead to less severe fire sales by addressing the inefficiency and reducing risky assets -- however, we show that banks respond to stricter capital requirements by decreasing their liquidity ratios. Anticipating this response, the regulator preemptively sets capital ratios at high levels. Ultimately, this interplay between banks and the regulator leads to inefficiently low levels of risky assets and liquidity. Macroprudential liquidity requirements that complement capital regulations, as in Basel III, restore constrained efficiency, improve financial stability and allow for a higher level of investment in risky assets.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2016026pap.pdf,fedgfe:34983:original
Self-confirming Price Dispersion in Monetary Economies,"Baughman, Garth, Rabinovich, Stanislav",N/A,"In a monetary economy, we show that price dispersion arises as an equilibrium outcome without the need for costly simultaneous search or any heterogeneity in preferences, production costs, or search technologies. A distribution of money holdings among buyers makes sellers indifferent across a set of posted prices, leading to a non-degenerate price distribution. This price distribution, in turn, makes buyers indifferent across a range of money balances, rationalizing the non-degenerate distribution of money holdings. We completely characterize the distribution of posted prices and money holdings in any equilibrium. Equilibria with price dispersion admit higher maximum prices than observed in any single-price equilibrium. Also, price dispersion reduces welfare by creating mismatch between posted prices and money balances. Inflation exacerbates this welfare loss by shifting the distribution towards higher prices.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018046pap.pdf,fedgfe:35253:original
Implications of Student Loan COVID-19 Pandemic Relief Measures for Families with Children,"Isen, Adam, Mezza, Alvaro, Hannon, Simona, Goodman, Sarena",N/A,"The initial years of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic fallout likely posed particular financial strain on U.S. households with children, who faced income disruptions from widespread jobs and hours cuts in addition to new childcare and instruction demands. One common expense for many such households is their student loan payment. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act included provisions to curb the impacts of these payments, which have been extended several times. These measures were not targeted and thus applied independent of need. This chapter analyzes two nationally representative datasets and finds: 1) families with children were more likely to benefit from pandemic student loan relief than those without children, but this relief was concentrated among higher-income and White families and 2) there were larger improvements in overall credit health and an increased use of other credit among families with student loan debt that was eligible for relief relative to those with student loan debt that was not.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2023025pap.pdf,fedgfe:96121:original

I explore the conditions under which such multiplicity occurs and characterize the dynamic properties in the neighborhood of each steady state. Models with standard incomplete markets, portfolio costs, a debt-elastic interest rate, or an overlapping generations framework allow for multiple steady states, if the model features multiple steady states under financial autarchy. If the excess demand for the foreign traded good is increasing in the good's own price in a given steady state, the equilibrium dynamics around this steady state are unbounded. Otherwise, the dynamics are bounded and unique. By contrast, with Uzawa-type preferences, the steady state is always unique and the associated equilibrium dynamics are always bounded and unique.

U.S. international transactions in 2002,"Kamin, Steven B.",N/A,"After slightly narrowing during the cyclical slowdown of 2001, the U.S. current account deficit widened in 2002, as it had over the previous decade. Two-thirds of the increase in the deficit last year was attributable to an increase in the deficit for trade in goods and services. In addition, net investment income receded as receipts from abroad declined more than payments on foreign investments in the United States. The record $503 billion U.S. current account deficit registered in 2002 was financed by continued high levels of private capital inflows and stepped-up foreign official purchases of U.S. assets. If economic activity picks up in the United States and in its major trading partners later this year, as most forecasters expect, the U.S. external deficit likely will widen as U.S. imports of goods and services rise by a greater amount than U.S. exports of goods and services. The decline in the dollar from early 2002 to date is unlikely to restrain the widening of the deficit by much, as it has been relatively small and its effects will be spread over a number of years.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2003/0503lead.pdf,fedgrb:15446

A time series model with periodic stochastic regime switching,"Ghysels, Eric",N/A,"A general class of Markov switching regime time series models is presented that allows one to estimate the nontrivial interdependencies between different types of cycles which make the economy grow at an unsteady rate. The paper further explores results obtained in Ghysels (1991b) suggesting that the economy transits from recessions to expansions with an uneven propensity throughout the year. It is also built on the work of Hamilton (1989) who proposed a stochastic switching-regime model for GNP and has important connections with hidden periodic structures discussed by Tiao and Grupe (1980) or Hansen and Sargent (1990), for instance. The time series models we present may have periodic transition probabilities and the drifts may be seasonal. In the latter case, the model exhibits seasonal dummy variation that may change with the stage of the business cycle. While the model is intrinsically nonlinear and stochastic, it produces a linear representation with seasonal effects that appear to be deterministic. The paper provides an elaborate discussion of the regularity conditions for a well-defined covariance structure including explicit formula for characterizing first and second moments. Finally, we present empirical evidence using U.S. GNP data series which tends to support a periodic structure for switching probabilities. The most significant result is the following: it is found that the seasonal in GNP growth significantly affects switching probabilities for regime switches in the nonseasonal growth of GNP. We also analyze the out-of-sample forecast performance of the different models and find that the models exploiting seasonality in transition probabilities perform best.",http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/common/pub_detail.cfm?pb_autonum_id=82,fedmem:38947

Big data analytics: a new perspective,"Chudik, Alexander, Kapetanios, George, Pesaran, M. Hashem",N/A,"Model specification and selection are recurring themes in econometric analysis. Both topics become considerably more complicated in the case of large-dimensional data sets where the set of specification possibilities can become quite large. In the context of linear regression models, penalised regression has become the de facto benchmark technique used to trade off parsimony and fit when the number of possible covariates is large, often much larger than the number of available observations. However, issues such as the choice of a penalty function and tuning parameters associated with the use of penalised regressions remain contentious. In this paper, we provide an alternative approach that considers the statistical significance of the individual covariates one at a time, whilst taking full account of the multiple testing nature of the inferential problem involved. We refer to the proposed method as One Covariate at a Time Multiple Testing (OCMT) procedure. The OCMT has a number of advantages over the penalised regression methods: It is based on statistical inference and is therefore easier to interpret and relate to the classical statistical analysis, it allows working under more general assumptions, it is computationally simple and considerably faster, and it performs better in small samples for almost all of the five different sets of experiments considered in this paper. Despite its simplicity, the theory behind the proposed approach is quite complicated. We provide extensive theoretical and Monte Carlo results in support of adding the proposed OCMT model selection procedure to the toolbox of applied researchers.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/international/wpapers/2016/0268.pdf,feddgw:14410:original

Who Signs up for E-Verify? Insights from DHS Enrollment Records,"Orrenius, Pia M., Greer, Sarah, Zavodny, Madeline",N/A,"E-Verify is a federal electronic verification system that allows employers to check whether their newly hired workers are authorized to work in the United States. To use E-Verify, firms first must enroll with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Participation is voluntary for most private-sector employers in the United States, but eight states currently require all or most employers to use E-Verify. This article uses confidential data from DHS to examine patterns of employer enrollment in E-Verify. The results indicate that employers are much more likely to sign up in mandatory E-Verify states than in states without such mandates, but enrollment is still below 50 percent in states that require its use. Large employers are far more likely to sign up than small employers. In addition, employers are more likely to newly enroll in E-Verify when a state’s unemployment rate or population share of likely unauthorized immigrants rises. However, enrollment rates are lower in industries with higher shares of unauthorized workers. Taken as a whole, the results suggest that enrolling in the program is costly for employers in terms of both compliance and difficulty in hiring workers. A strictly enforced nationwide mandate that all employers use an employment eligibility program like E-Verify would be incompatible with the current reliance on a large unauthorized workforce. Allowing more workers to enter legally or legalizing existing workers might be necessary before implementing E-Verify nationally.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2020/wp2002.pdf,feddwp:87381:original
Mixed signals: labor markets and monetary policy,"Nechio, Fernanda, Daly, Mary C., Bosler, Canyon",N/A,"Since the Great Recession, standard ways of measuring the labor market have given mixed signals about the strength of the U.S. recovery.

Speculative capital inflows and exchange rate targeting in the Pacific Basin,"Kletzer, Kenneth M., Spiegel, Mark M.",N/A,"This paper studies the process of capital inflow management and speculative inflows for countries pursuing the joint goals of monetary and exchange rate management.  We introduce a sticky-price model with imperfect asset substitutability in which a central bank engages in costly sterilization to mitigate the influence of capital inflows on its policy targets.  The costs of sterilization, often referred to as \""quasi-fiscal costs\"" in the literature, reflect the loss experienced by the central bank by holding foreign securities whose nominal yields are inferior to those paid on domestic bonds.  Our model demonstrates that if the sterilization process reflects a real cost to the central bank, it will rationally choose to limit its sterilization activity. However, we argue that the true quasi-fiscal costs of sterilization to the central bank may not be as large as they appear if the spreads between yields on domestic and foreign securities reflect true default risk premia. ; We then obtain upper bound estimates for the quasi-fiscal costs of sterilization borne by six developing country nations which experienced large capital inflows.   Our results indicate that even our upper bound estimates of these costs are quite small, but can become non-trivially large during brief periods of capital inflow surges.  We then conduct parametric and time series studies to examine whether central bank behavior responded to these quasi-fiscal costs over the course of our sample.  Our results fail to indicate much of a role for quasi-fiscal costs during tranquil periods, but we find that some of the nations in our sample responded to large increases in quasi-fiscal costs by easing domestic credit.",,fedfpb:11744:original

In Search of Lost Time Aggregation,"Crawley, Edmund",N/A,"In 1960, Working noted that time aggregation of a random walk induces serial correlation in the first difference that is not present in the original series. This important contribution has been overlooked in a recent literature analyzing income and consumption in panel data.

Using new techniques to correct for the problem, I find the estimate for the partial insurance to transitory shocks, originally estimated to be 0.05, increases to 0.24.

The Effect of the China Connect,"Ma, Chang, Rogers, John H., Zhou, Sili",N/A,"We document the effect on Chinese firms of the Shanghai (Shenzhen)-Hong Kong Stock Connect. The Connect was an important capital account liberalization introduced in the mid-2010s. It created a channel for cross-border equity investments into a selected set of Chinese stocks while China's overall capital controls policy remained in place. Using a difference-in-difference approach, and with careful attention to sample selection issues, we find that mainland Chinese firm-level investment is negatively affected by contractionary U.S. monetary policy shocks and that firms in the Connect are more adversely affected than those outside of it. These effects are economically large, robust, and stronger for firms whose stock return has a higher covariance with the world market return. We also find that firms in the Connect enjoy lower financing costs, invest more, and have higher profitability than unconnected firms. We discuss the implications of our results for the debate on capital controls and independence of Chinese monetary policy.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019087pap.pdf,fedgfe:86700:original

"Asset mispricing, arbitrage, and volatility","Schmid, Frank A., Emmons, William R.",N/A,"Market efficiency remains a contentious topic among financial economists. The theoretical case for efficient markets rests on the notion of risk-free, cost-free arbitrage. In real markets, however, arbitrage is not risk-free or cost-free. In addition, the number of informed arbitrageurs and the supply of financial resources they have to invest in arbitrage strategies is limited. This article builds on an important recent model of arbitrage by professional traders who need?but lack?wealth of their own to trade. Professional abitrageurs must convince wealthy but uninformed investors to entrust them with investment capital in order to exploit mispricing and push market prices back toward intrinsic value. The authors introduce an objective function for the arbitrageur that resembles real-world contracts. Also, the authors calibrate the objective function to show that arbitrage generally has a price-stabilizing influence and reduces volatility in asset returns.",https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/02/11/EmmonsSchmid.pdf,fedlrv:24757

Can Community Colleges Step Up as Engines of Economic Recovery?,"Jacoby, Tamar",N/A,"In midsummer 2010, the New York Times sent a reporter to the Rust Belt to talk to manufacturing employers.1 Had the picture brightened in their sector?

The answer was unexpected and bittersweet. Manufacturing was slowly coming back, and plants were starting to rehire. But even with a vast pool of unemployed workers to draw on, employers were having trouble filling jobs. ""The people that are out of work don’t match the jobs that are open and growing,"" one Midwesterner explained.

Midwest manufacturers had retooled as they came out of the downturn, making a quantum leap of automation that made many of their old workers obsolete. An array of new jobs was available for people who could operate computerized machinery and do the math now required to solve even routine problems in the plant. These new jobs often paid better than the jobs that had been eliminated, but employers couldn’t find qualified workers.

Today, a similar threat is looming as businesses reopen in the wake of the COVID-19 lockdown. Millions of Americans are going to need fast, job-focused upskilling and reskilling to get back to work.

Robust inference in models identified via heteroskedasticity,"Lewis, Daniel J.",N/A,"Identification via heteroskedasticity exploits differences in variances across regimes to identify parameters in simultaneous equations. I study weak identification in such models, which arises when variances change very little or the variances of multiple shocks change close to proportionally. I show that this causes standard inference to become unreliable, outline two tests to detect weak identification, and establish conditions for the validity of nonconservative methods for robust inference on an empirically relevant subset of the parameter vector. I apply these tools to monetary policy shocks, identified using heteroskedasticity in high frequency data. I detect weak identification in daily data, causing standard inference methods to be invalid. However, using intraday data instead allows the shocks to be strongly identified.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr876.pdf,fednsr:12415
Rehypothecation,"Monnet, Cyril",N/A,"How would you feel if even though you were making regular monthly payments, your mortgage bank sold your house? This may seem like an odd question, but this type of situation happens every day in financial markets in a practice known as rehypothecation. Although such practices may be hard for nontraders to understand, rehypothecation is widespread in financial markets. Following the crisis of 2007-2009, the Dodd-Frank Act put restrictions on rehypothecation for derivatives. To understand the scope of these restrictions, we need to understand the role of rehypothecation in financial trades. In this article, Cyril Monnet discusses questions such as: Which party to a financial trade does rehypothecation benefit? Are there limits to its advantages? And how should it be regulated? There are no hard and fast answers to the last question, but the author notes that we can make a more informed decision about the pros and cons of various forms of regulation if we understand the underlying economics.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/economy/articles/business-review/2011/q4/brq411_Rehypothecation.pdf,fedpbr:31969
The optimum quantity of money,"Sanches, Daniel R.",N/A,"A central premise of monetary policy in the U.S. throughout the first decade of the 21st century has been a firm commitment to avoid deflation. Indeed, it is the consensus view of policymakers and most economists. Nonetheless, Nobel laureate Milton Friedman proposed that optimal monetary policy should lead to a steady rate of deflation. For some economists, the Friedman rule is mainly a benchmark for thinking clearly about the assumptions underlying our models and a systematic guide for deciding how to modify our models, that is, a way of making scientific progress. However, it is not an exaggeration to say that most of the work in the field of monetary theory has focused on identifying situations in which Friedman?s insight does not apply. In this article, Daniel Sanches discusses the Friedman rule and the main arguments that have been made against it.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/economy/articles/business-review/2012/q4/brq412_optimum-quantity-of-money.pdf,fedpbr:32278

"A panel study of investment: sales, cash flow, the cost of capital, and leverage","Kopcke, Richard W., Howrey, Mark M.",N/A,"This article compares the investment spending for each of 396 corporations during the late 1980s and early 1990s to projections of their spending derived from several basic models of investment. According to these models, capital spending, on average, adheres closely to output, profits, and the cost of capital. The pattern of average forecast errors derived from the statistical models does not correspond very closely to measures of indebtedness, liquidity, size, or type of business. It is not surprising that these variables should influence capital spending so little, once the general business climate (represented by sales or cash flow) has been taken into account. ; For the making of economic policy, the evidence suggests that the familiar macroeconomic incentives for investment would be no less effective today than they have been in the past. In particular, the volume of investment spending would appear to respond to monetary and fiscal policies in the customary way. Despite their potential differences, the models agree that monetary or fiscal policy must be unusually aggressive to increase investment spending substantially when the rate of growth of GDP is unusually low.",http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/neer/neer1994/neer194b.pdf,fedbne:41326
The role of savings and investment in balancing the current account: some empirical evidence from the United States,"Olivei, Giovanni P.",N/A,"Current account deficits ultimately reflect a disparity between a country's national savings and investment. As such, the issue of how current account balance is achieved in practice can be viewed  in terms of whether it is savings or investment that adjusts to an external deficit. In this article, the author examines empirically how savings and investment have responded to current account imbalances in the United States over the past 40 years. The main finding is that, on average, investment was largely responsible for rebalancing the current account in the long run. The finding that investment has borne the largest fraction of the external adjustment conforms with the view that, in the long run, the national savings rate constrains a country's rate of investment. Thus, in a situation with outstanding net external debt, low levels of national savings ultimately imply low levels of domestic investment. To the extent that one views net additions of capital as essential for a country's future growth prospects, low savings may signify a reduction in future standards of living.",http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/neer/neer2000/neer400a.htm,fedbne:41448

Interest Rate Surprises: A Tale of Two Shocks,"Ozdagli, Ali, Nunes, Ricardo, Tang, Jenny",N/A,"Interest rate surprises around FOMC announcements reveal both the surprise in the monetary policy stance (the pure policy shock) and interest rate movements driven by exogenous information about the economy from the central bank (the information shock). In order to disentangle the effects of these two shocks, we use interest rate changes on days of macroeconomic data releases. On these release dates, there are no pure policy shocks, which allows us to identify the impact of information shocks and thereby distill pure policy shocks from interest rate surprises around FOMC announcements. Our results show that there is a prominent central bank information component in the widely used high-frequency policy rate surprise measure that needs to be parsed out. When we remove this central bank information component, the estimated effects of monetary policy shocks are more pronounced relative to those estimated using the entire policy rate surprise.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2022/interest-rate-surprises-a-tale-of-two-shocks.aspx,fedbwp:93691:original

The authors examine three possible reasons for the extension of this selective credit subsidy to community banks and thrifts, including the need to subsidize community depository institutions, stabilize the Federal Home Loan Banks, and address a market failure for small enterprise loans in rural banking markets.

Can Supply Shocks Be Inflationary with a Flat Phillips Curve?,"L’Huillier, Jean-Paul, Phelan, Gregory",N/A,"Not in standard models. With conventional pricing frictions, imposing a flat Phillips curve also imposes a price level that is rigid with respect to supply shocks. In the New Keynesian model, price markup shocks need to be several orders of magnitude bigger than other shocks in order to fit the data, leading to unreasonable assessments of the magnitude of the increase in costs during inflationary episodes. To account for the facts, we propose a strategic microfoundation of shock-dependent price stickiness: prices are sticky with respect to demand shocks but flexible with respect to supply shocks. This friction is demand-intrinsic, in line with narrative accounts for the imperfect adjustment of prices. Firms can credibly justify a price increase due to a rise in costs, whereas it is harder to do so when demand increases. Inflation from supply shocks is efficient and does not justify a monetary policy response.",https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-202336,fedcwq:97528:original

Profits and balance sheet developments at U.S. commercial banks in 2000,"Bassett, William F., Zakrajšek, Egon",N/A,"The profitability of the U.S. commercial banking industry remained robust in 2000, but returns on equity and on commercial bank assets fell back somewhat from the peak reached in 1999. The falloff reflected a continuation of the decline in net interest margin that dates from the extraordinarily high levels of the early 1990s, a significant increase in loan-loss provisions, and a notable slowing in noninterest income growth. The expansion of bank balance sheets was much stronger in 2000 than in the preceding year, as growth of both loans and securities accelerated. The pickup in loan growth resulted mainly from a marked decline in securitizations, which boosted the growth of consumer loans in bank portfolios, and from business and real estate lending. The faster growth of securities was due to a surge in trading accounts, as runoffs of U.S. Treasury securities damped the growth of investment accounts.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2001/0601lead.pdf,fedgrb:15940

By constructing a simple dynamic framework in which fertility and rural-urban migration decisions are both determined, we show that more-rapid urban productivity advancement can lead to a positive relationship between migration and fertility. Using cross-country data analysis, we support our theory, establishing that both migration and fertility rates are higher in less-developed countries than in advanced economies. Our results imply that policies that may help reduce the cost of urban living or enhance urban benefits would be useful for productive structural transformation.",https://files.stlouisfed.org/research/publications/review/2020/10/22/fertility-and-internal-migration.pdf,fedlrv:89128

Great expectations and the end of the depression,"Eggertsson, Gauti B.",N/A,"This paper argues that the U.S. economy's recovery from the Great Depression was driven by a shift in expectations brought about by the policy actions of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. On the monetary policy side, Roosevelt abolished the gold standard and-even more important-announced the policy objective of inflating the price level to pre-depression levels. On the fiscal policy side, Roosevelt expanded real and deficit spending. Together, these actions made his policy objective credible; they violated prevailing policy dogmas and introduced a policy regime change such as that described in work by Sargent and by Temin and Wigmore.

For example, unless restrictions are imposed on the general difference and trend stationary models, the exact size of any consistent unit root test rises to one with sample size. Bayesian posteriors regarding unit roots are arbitrary in the sense that given any prior, there are other priors that agree with the first regarding empirical outcomes, but that imply arbitrarily different unit root posteriors.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/1993/447/default.htm,fedgif:36922:original
Returns to Active Management: The Case of Hedge Funds,"Kazemi, Maziar, Islamaj, Ergys",N/A,"Do more active hedge fund managers generate higher returns than their less active peers? We attempt to answer this question. Using Kalman Filter techniques, we estimate the risk exposure dynamics of a large sample of live and dead equity long-short hedge funds. These estimates are then used to develop a measure of activeness for each hedge fund. Our results show that there exists a nonlinear relationship between activeness and performance. Using raw returns as a measure of performance, it is found that more active funds outperform the less active ones. However, when risk adjusted returns are used to measure performance, we find the opposite results; that is, activeness is inversely related to returns. Still, we find that a few very active managers outperform the moderately active funds and generate higher returns. We conclude that the most active managers use their skills to manage the riskiness of their portfolios and are, therefore, able to provide higher risk adjusted returns. Finally, we find that compared to the least active managers, the most active managers are less homogeneous and, therefore, due diligence is far more important when selecting an active manager.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2014/1112/ifdp1112.pdf,fedgif:37535:original

Are banks dead? Or are the reports greatly exaggerated?,"Gertler, Mark, Boyd, John H.",N/A,"This article reexamines the conventional wisdom that commercial banking is in severe decline. A careful reading of the evidence does not support it. True, on-balance sheet assets held by commercial banks have declined as a share of total intermediary assets. But this measure ignores the substantial growth in banks' off-balance sheet activities, in off-shore lending by foreign banks, and in the size of the financial intermediation sector. Adjusted for these considerations, the bank-assets measure shows no clear evidence of secular decline. Neither does an alternative measure, constructed using data from the national income accounts. At most, banking may have suffered a slight loss of market share lately. But this loss is a temporary response to a series of adverse shocks rather than the start of a permanent decline.",http://minneapolisfed.org/research/qr/qr1831.html,fedmqr:41697

Capital flows & current account deficits in the 1990s: why did Latin America & East Asian countries respond differently?,"Antzoulatos, Angelos A.",N/A,"The return of private capital to highly indebted less-developed countries (LDCs) in the late 1980s was accompanied by widening current account deficits in the recipient countries, which were primarily attributed to a consumption boom in Latin America and an investment surge in East Asia. Interpreting the return as an increase in the external debt ceiling, the maximum amount that can be borrowed, this paper analyzes and compares the different response of the two regions using the conceptual framework of a borrowing-constrained agent. According to it, an increase in the debt ceiling can reduce precautionary savings, and induce higher demand (and widening current account deficits) even when the borrowing constraint does not bind. Moreover, the increase in demand should be decreasing in the original ceiling. The results from a panel of fourteen Latin American and a panel of eight East Asian countries are consistent with the framework. They also indicate that the different response of the two regions can, to a large extent, be explained by Latin America's lower ceiling prior to the return.

On the Validity of Classical and Bayesian DSGE-Based Inference,"Petrova, Katerina",N/A,"This paper studies large sample classical and Bayesian inference in a prototypical linear DSGE model and demonstrates that inference on the structural parameters based on a Gaussian likelihood is unaffected by departures from Gaussianity of the structural shocks. This surprising result is due to a cancellation in the asymptotic variance resulting into a generalized information equality for the block corresponding to the structural parameters. The underlying reason for the cancellation is the certainty equivalence property of the linear rational expectation model.

The main implication of this result is that classical and Bayesian Gaussian inference achieve a semi-parametric efficiency bound and there is no need for a “sandwich-form” correction of the asymptotic variance of the structural parameters. Consequently, MLE-based confidence intervals and Bayesian credible sets of the deep parameters based on a Gaussian likelihood have correct asymptotic coverage even when the structural shocks are non-Gaussian. On the other hand, inference on the reduced-form parameters characterizing the volatility of the shocks is invalid whenever the structural shocks have a non-Gaussian density and the paper proposes a simple Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm that achieves correct large sample inference for the volatility parameters.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr1084.pdf,fednsr:97624

Small business use of credit cards in the U.S. market,"Herbst-Murphy, Susan",N/A,"America?s small businesses have adopted credit cards as both a payment method and a borrowing vehicle. The segment also uses other payment card products, including debit, charge, and prepaid cards. The dollar volume of spending with cards designed for small businesses increased by 230 percent over the five-year period from 2003-2008. But the recession of 2007-2009 and contemporaneous changes in the regulatory environment had effects on both the supply to and demand of small businesses with respect to credit cards. To obtain an update on these issues, the Payment Cards Center hosted a workshop facilitated by Frank Martien, a partner with First Annapolis Consulting. During the workshop, Martien presented evidence of improved supply and demand conditions for small business credit cards. In addition to these positive post-recession observations, Martien described how the symmetry between a small firm?s accounts receivable cycle and the billing cycle for a credit card may help explain why credit card use is so attractive to this segment.

New England banks and the Texas experience,"Simons, Katerina",N/A,"New England banks are currently suffering from problems similar to those that caused the demise of many Texas banks. In both cases, a boom in the real-estate sector was followed by a sharp contraction caused by weakness in the leading sectors of the economy. In both cases, banks had greatly expanded their real-estate lending, and the declining real-estate prices produced substantial loan losses. ; This study suggests, however, that these similarities do not imply that New England will go on to repeat the Texas experience.

As in related models of social interactions, a change in exogenous variables or contract terms generates a social multiplier. In this environment, small differences in fundamentals such as skill or effort cost can lead to large differences in group productivity. We characterize the optimal contract for this environment and describe the properties of equilibria, properties that agree with stylized facts on effort compression in revenue-sharing settings.

Modeling anchoring effects in sequential Likert scale questions,"Hitczenko, Marcin",N/A,"Surveys in many different research fields rely on sequences of Likert scale questions to assess individuals' general attitudes toward a set of related topics. Most analyses of responses to such a series do not take into account the potential measurement error introduced by the context effect we dub \""sequential anchoring,\"" which occurs when the rating for one question influences the rating given to the following question by favoring similar ratings. The presence of sequential anchoring can cause systematic bias in the study of relative ratings. We develop a latent-variable framework for question responses that capitalizes on different question orderings in the survey to identify the presence of sequential anchoring. We propose a parameter estimation algorithm and run simulations to test its effectiveness for different data-generating processes, sample sizes, and orderings. Finally, the model is applied to data in which eight payment instruments are rated on a five-point scale for each of six payment characteristics in the 2012 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice. We find consistent evidence of sequential anchoring, resulting in sizable differences in properties of relative ratings for certain instruments.",http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp2013/wp1315.pdf,fedbwp:7244:original
Can studies of application denials and mortgage defaults uncover taste-based discrimination?,"Tootell, Geoffrey M. B.",N/A,"Several articles in the popular press have asserted that a simple comparison of average mortgage default rates for white and minority applicants is necessary and sufficient to uncover discrimination in mortgage lending. The fallacy of this assertion has been examined in Peterson (1981), Tootell (1993), and Yinger (1993). These papers show that a failure to account for the financial characteristics of each application or loan makes a simple comparison of average rates meaningless. However, recent empirical work on discrimination in mortgage lending has examined both application denial and mortgage default rates conditional on the strength of each application, not average rates for whites and minorities. This paper assesses the information about discrimination contained in these conditional rates. It is found that the debate over denial versus defaults is misdirected; examining denials is a marginally better method to uncover discrimination. Much of the apparent debate was really over the potential importance of omitted variables.",http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp1996/wp96_10.htm,fedbwp:7378:original

We show that such behavior may increase welfare when private suppliers have market power. We do this by studying the staggered rollout of hundreds of government milk “ration stores” in Mexico using a proprietary panel of household food purchases. The rollout lowered the price per liter of privately supplied milk by 2.4% and increased household consumption. To compare direct
provision with budget-neutral alternatives, we develop and estimate an equilibrium model of the market that accounts for quality differences.

The shifty Laffer curve,"Becsi, Zsolt",N/A,"Any number of U.S. politicians owe their success to emphasizing tax cutting. According to logic, voters are opting for fewer government services or for changes in the mix of services rendered. It is at this point that things become complicated, however, because what happens to expenditures influences how much revenue a government needs to collect. The author of this article observes that a good place to start in understanding the impacts of tax policy is with what is popularly known as the Laffer curve. This curve became famous early in the 1980s when tax rates fell but tax revenues did not rise as the curve predicted, and the United States resorted to deficit spending. This article examines the macroeconomic and conceptual issues that may have made a difference. ; Because most analyses of the Laffer curve occur in a static framework that has proved inadequate, this analysis presents a simple dynamic model useful for analyzing the long-run effects of tax policies. The model also can easily be extended to analyze the disposition of government revenues and the consequent effects on national income. ; It turns out that how the government spends its tax revenues-on consumption, investment, or transfers-is important for understanding the Laffer curve. In fact, a different Laffer curve is associated with the different ways revenues are spent, and it is important to know which curve one is operating on when designing tax policies.",https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/economic-review/2000/vol85no3_becsi.pdf,fedaer:30575

"National, regional and metro-specific factors of the U.S. housing market","Fu, Dong",N/A,"We build a dynamic latent factor model to decompose housing prices in major U.S. metropolitan areas into national, regional, and metro-specific idiosyncratic factors, in order to distinguish the different dynamics behind housing price movements. We find that there is a distinctive national factor that has contributed about one-fourth of the individual metropolitan's housing price volatility. The regional factor accounts for another one-fourth and the idiosyncratic factor explains about half of housing price fluctuations. However, at the regional level, the factors' contributions vary across a fairly wide range. Although it only has modest explanatory power of housing price volatility, the national factor seems to account for much of the price increase in the current housing boom. Interestingly, the regional factor exerts negative influence on housing prices in a fairly large number of metros lately, only to be outweighed by the national factor's positive contribution. We also explore the possible forces influencing the national factor of housing price movements, including monetary policy, population growth, real economic activity, general inflation and other asset prices.",https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/research/papers/2007/wp0707.pdf,feddwp:27805:original

We estimate this specification for a cross-section of nations from 1960 through 1995. Our results support the logistic specification, and are robust to a number of sensitivity checks. ; Our model also appears to predict slow total factor productivity growth well. 22 of the 27 nations that we identify as lacking the critical human capital levels needed to achieve faster total factor productivity growth than the leader nation in 1960 did achieve lower growth over the next 35 years.",https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/spiegel.pdf,fedfpr:28606

Transmission of Sovereign Risk to Bank Lending,"Başkaya, Yusuf Soner, Hardy, Bryan, Kalemli-Özcan, Ṣebnem, Yue, Vivian Z.",N/A,"Banks hold a significant exposure to their own sovereigns. An increase in sovereign risk may hurt banks' balance sheets, causing a decrease in lending and a decline in economic activity. We quantify the transmission of sovereign risk to bank lending and provide new evidence about the effect of sovereign risk on economic outcomes. We consider the 1999 Marmara earthquake in Turkey as an exogenous shock leading to an increase in Turkey's default risk. Our empirical estimates show that, for banks holding a higher amount of government securities, the exogenous change in sovereign default risk tightens banks' financial constraints significantly. The banks' resulting tighter financial constraints translate into lower credit provision, suggesting that there is a significant balance-sheet channel in transmitting a higher sovereign default risk toward real economic activity.",https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/policy-hub/2023/02/27/02--transmission-of-sovereign-risk-to-bank-lending.pdf,a00068:96728

Introducing financial frictions and unemployment into a small open economy model,"Christiano, Lawrence J., Trabandt, Mathias, Walentin, Karl",N/A,"The current financial crisis has made it abundantly clear that business cycle modeling can no longer abstract from financial factors. It is also clear that the current standard approach of modeling labor markets without explicit unemployment has its limitations. We extend what is becoming the standard new Keynesian model in three dimensions. First, we incorporate financial frictions in the accumulation and management of capital. Second, we model the labor market using a search and matching framework. Third, we extend the model into a small open economy setting. Finally, we estimate the model using Bayesian techniques with Swedish data. Our main results are as follows: (1) The financial shock to entrepreneurial wealth is pivotal for explaining business cycle fluctuations. It accounts for two-thirds of the variance in investment and a quarter of the variance in GDP. (2) The marginal efficiency of investment shock has very limited importance. The reason for this is that we match financial market data. (3) In contrast to the existing literature on estimated DSGE models, our model does not need any wage markup shocks or similar shocks with low autocorrelation to match the data. Furthermore, the low-frequency labor preference shock that we do allow is not important in explaining GDP. (4) The tightness of the labor market is unimportant for the cost of adjusting the workforce. In other words, there are costs of hiring but no significant costs of vacancy postings per se.",http://www.frbatlanta.org/documents/cqer/publicationscq/cqerwp/cqer_wp10-04.pdf,fedacq:33508:original

This paper explores the degree to which the role of education and marriage in women's labor supply decisions also changed over this time period. Specifically, this paper investigates women's decisions to exit the labor market upon the birth of a child. The results indicate that changing exit behavior among married, educated women at this period in their lives was not likely the driving force behind the aggregate changes seen in labor force participation. Rather, changes in exit rates among single women, particularly those less educated, are much more consistent with the changing pattern of aggregate female labor force participation.",http://www.frbatlanta.org/documents/pubs/wp/wp1002.pdf,fedawp:13321:original

Robust inference in linear asset pricing models,"Robotti, Cesare, Gospodinov, Nikolay, Kan, Raymond",N/A,"We derive new results on the asymptotic behavior of the estimated parameters of a linear asset pricing model and their associated t-statistics in the presence of a factor that is independent of the returns. The inclusion of this \""useless\"" factor in the model leads to a violation of the full rank (identification) condition and renders the inference nonstandard. We show that the estimated parameter associated with the useless factor diverges with the sample size but the misspecification-robust t-statistic is still well-behaved and has a standard normal limiting distribution. The asymptotic distributions of the estimates of the remaining parameters and the model specification test are also affected by the presence of a useless factor and are nonstandard. We propose a robust and easy-to-implement model selection procedure that restores the standard inference on the parameters of interest by identifying and removing the factors that do not contribute to improved pricing. The finite-sample properties of our asymptotic approximations and the practical relevance of our results are illustrated using simulations and an empirical application.",http://www.frbatlanta.org/documents/pubs/wp/wp1217.pdf,fedawp:13471:original
Did the 2017 Tax Reform Discriminate against Blue State Voters?,"Leiseca, Michael, Auerbach, Alan J., Ye, Victor, Altig, David E., Higgins, Patrick C., Koehler, Darryl, Terry, Ellie, Kotlikoff, Laurence J.",N/A,"The Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) made significant changes to corporate and personal federal income taxation, including limiting the SALT (state and local property, income and sales taxes) deductibility to $10,000. States with high SALT tend to vote Democratic. This paper estimates the differential effect of the TCJA on red- and blue-state taxpayers and investigates the importance of the SALT limitation to this differential. We calculate the effect of permanent implementation of the TCJA on households using The Fiscal Analyzer: a life-cycle, consumption-smoothing program incorporating all major federal and state fiscal policies. We find that the average percentage increase in remaining lifetime spending under the TCJA is 1.6 percent in red states versus 1.3 percent in blue states. Among the richest 10 percent of households, this differential is larger. Rich households in red states enjoyed a 2.0 percent increase compared to a 1.2 percent increase among the rich in blue-state households. This gap is driven almost entirely by the limitation on the SALT deduction. Excluding the SALT limitation from the TCJA results in a spending gain of 2.6 percent for rich red-state households compared to 2.7 percent for rich blue-state households.",https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/wp/2019/07-did-the-2017-tax-reform-discriminate-against-blue-state-voters-2019-04-10.pdf,fedawp:13841:original

Shoe-leather costs of inflation and policy credibility,"Pakko, Michael R.",N/A,"Inflation can cause costly misallocations of resources as consumers seek to protect the purchasing power of their nominal assets. In this article, Michael R. Pakko discusses the nature of these distortions - known as \\""shoe-leather\\"" costs - in a model where the demand for money is motivated by a \\""shopping-time\\"" constraint. While the estimates of the shoe-leather costs of long-run inflation (implied by this model) are generally consistent with previous studies, the article goes on to show that the transition between inflation rates can involve dynamics that alter the nature of these welfare effects. Specifically, the benefits of a disinflation policy are mitigated by the gradual adjustment of the economy in response to a lower inflation rate. This transition can be particularly protracted when there is uncertainty about the credibility of the disinflation policy.",https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/98/11/9811mp.pdf,fedlrv:25737
Decomposing the Government Transfer Multiplier,"Zhou, Yijiang, Dupor, Bill, Conley, Timothy G., Li, Rong",N/A,"We estimate the local, spillover and aggregate causal effects of government transfers on personal income. We identify exogenous changes in federal transfers to residents at the state-level using legislated social security cost-of-living adjustments between 1952 and 1974. Each effect is measured as a multiplier: the change in personal income in response to a one unit change in transfers. The local multiplier, i.e., the effect of own-state transfers on own-state income holding fixed other state's income, at a four-quarter horizon is approximately 3.4. The cross-state spillover multiplier is about -0.7, but not statistically different from zero. The aggregate multiplier, i.e., the sum of its local and spillover components, equals 2.7. More generally, our paper provides a template for conducting inference that decomposes an aggregate effect into its local and spillover components.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/real.stlouisfed.org/wp/2023/2023-017.pdf,fedlwp:96497

Technology capital and the U.S. current account,"Prescott, Edward C., McGrattan, Ellen R.",N/A,"The rate of return on capital of U.S. foreign subsidiaries has been much higher than the rate of return on capital of U.S. affiliates of foreign companies. Over the period 1982-2005, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates that the difference in returns, after subtracting taxes, averaged 6.3 percent per year. One explanation explored in this paper is the fact that multinationals make large intangible investments that affect profits but are excluded from BEA capital stock measures. Differences in reported returns on foreign direct investment (FDI) could exist if there were differences in the timing and magnitude of these foreign intangible investments. We explore this possibility using a growth model with two types of intangible capital: plant-specific intangible capital and technology capital. Technology capital is accumulated know-how from investments in research and development (R&D), brands, and organizations that can be used in as many available locations as firms choose. As countries open up, there are gains to foreign direct investment with more locations available in which to put technology capital. We choose parameters of our model to mimic the U.S. current accounts and find that the mismeasurement of incomes and capital stocks accounts for a little over half of the difference in reported returns.",http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/common/pub_detail.cfm?pb_autonum_id=1077,fedmwp:42465:original

In contrast to the hypothesis, wage cyclicality in these two firms is driven by changes in salaries associated with jobs rather than by worker movement. An additional finding is that salaries in the two firms are countercyclical.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/1997/199701/199701abs.html,fedgfe:33878:original
"On the relationships between real consumption, income and wealth","Rudd, Jeremy B., Palumbo, Michael G., Whelan, Karl",N/A,"The existence of durable goods implies that the welfare flow from consumption cannot be directly associated with total consumption expenditures. As a result, tests of standard theories of consumption (such as the Permanent Income Hypothesis, or PIH) typically focus on nondurable goods and services. Specifically, these studies generally relate real consumption of nondurable goods and services to measures of real income and wealth, where the latter are deflated by a price index for total consumption expenditures. We demonstrate that this procedure is only valid under the assumption that real consumption of nondurables and services is a constant multiple of aggregate real consumption outlays--an assumption that represents a very poor description of U.S. data. We develop an alternative approach that is based on the observation that the ratio of these series has historically been stable in nominal terms, and use this approach to examine two basic predictions of the PIH.

Lack of signal error (LoSE) and implications for OLS regression: measurement error for macro data,"Nalewaik, Jeremy J.",N/A,"This paper proposes a simple generalization of the classical measurement error model, introducing new measurement errors that subtract signal from the true variable of interest, in addition to the usual classical measurement errors (CME) that add noise. The effect on OLS regression of these lack of signal errors (LoSE) is opposite the conventional wisdom about CME: while CME in the explanatory variables causes attenuation bias, LoSE in the dependent variable, not the explanatory variables, causes a similar bias under some conditions. In addition, LoSE in the dependent variable shrinks the variance of the regression residuals, making inference potentially misleading. The paper provides evidence that LoSE is an important source of error in US macroeconomic quantity data such as GDP growth, illustrates downward bias in regressions of GDP growth on asset prices, and provides recommendations for econometric practice.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2008/200815/200815abs.html,fedgfe:34216:original

Why Are Some Places So Much More Unequal Than Others?,"Deitz, Richard, Abel, Jaison R.",N/A,"This study examines the magnitude and sources of regional wage inequality in the United States. The authors find that, as in the nation as a whole, wage inequality has increased in nearly every metropolitan area since the early 1980s, though there is significant variation among places in both the degree of wage inequality and the pace at which it has risen. The most unequal places tend to be large urban areas that have benefited from strong demand for skill and agglomeration economies, with these factors leading to particularly rapid wage growth for high-skilled workers. The least unequal places tend to have seen weak demand for labor, largely as a consequence of technological change and globalization, and this weakness has led to lackluster wage growth across the entire wage distribution— particularly for middle- and lower-skilled workers. These findings suggest that a relatively low level of regional wage inequality is often the result of a weakening local economy, while relatively high regional wage inequality is often a consequence of strong but uneven economic growth.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/epr/2019/epr_2019_wage-inequality_abel-deitz.pdf,fednep:86712

Innovation takes the form of pooling and tranching of assets and the creation of separate structures with different seniority, different risk, and different capital charges, a process that captures some stylized features of structured finance. Regulation is motivated by the divergence of private and social interests in future profits. Capital regulation lowers bank profits and may induce banks to innovate in order to evade the regulation itself. We show that structured finance can improve welfare in some cases.

"Bank Complexity, Governance, and Risk","Correa, Ricardo, Goldberg, Linda S.",N/A,"Bank holding companies (BHCs) can be complex organizations, conducting multiple lines of business through many distinct legal entities and across a range of geographies. While such complexity raises the costs of bank resolution when organizations fail, the effect of complexity on BHCs’ broader risk profiles is less well understood. Business, organizational, and geographic complexity can engender explicit trade-offs between the agency problems that increase risk and the diversification, liquidity management, and synergy improvements that reduce risk. The outcomes of such trade-offs may depend on bank governance arrangements. We test these conjectures using data on large U.S. BHCs for the 1996-2018 period. Organizational complexity and geographic scope tend to provide diversification gains and reduce idiosyncratic and liquidity risks while also increasing BHCs’ exposure to systematic and systemic risks. Regulatory changes focused on organizational complexity have significantly reduced this type of complexity, leading to a decrease in systemic risk and an increase in liquidity risk among BHCs. While bank governance structures have, in some cases, significantly affected the buildup of BHC complexity, better governance arrangements have not moderated the effects of complexity on risk outcomes.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr930.html,fednsr:88198

We investigate possible explanations for these findings. Our results are consistent with bank loan officers placing too much weight on their private information, a form of overconfidence.

Identifying the role of moral hazard in international financial markets,"Kamin, Steven B.",N/A,"Considerable attention has been paid to the possibility that large-scale IMF-led financing packages may have distorted incentives in international financial markets, leading private investors to provide more credit to emerging market countries, and at lower interest rates, than might otherwise have been the case. Yet, prior attempts to identify such distortions have yielded mixed evidence, at best. This paper makes three contributions to our ability to assess the empirical importance of moral hazard in international financial markets. First, it is argued that because large international \""bailouts\"" did not commence until the 1995 Mexican crisis, financial indicators prior to that time could not have reflected a significant degree of this type of moral hazard. Therefore, one test for the existence of moral hazard is that the access of emerging markets to international credit is significantly easier than it was prior to 1995. Second, the paper argues that because private investors expect large-scale IMF-led packages to be extended primarily to economically or geo-politically important countries, moral hazard, if it exists, should lead these countries to have easier terms of access to credit than smaller, non-systemically important countries. Finally, in addition to looking at bond spreads, the focus of earlier empirical analyses of moral hazard, the paper also examines trends in capital flows to gauge the access of emerging market countries to external finance. Looking at the evidence in light of these considerations, the paper concludes that there is little support for the view that moral hazard is significantly distorting international capital markets at the present time.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2002/736/default.htm,fedgif:36780:original
Complex-Task Biased Technological Change and the Labor Market,"Kambourov, Gueorgui, Caines, Colin C., Hoffmann, Florian",N/A,"In this paper we study the relationship between task complexity and the occupational wage- and employment structure. Complex tasks are defined as those requiring higher-order skills, such as the ability to abstract, solve problems, make decisions, or communicate effectively. We measure the task complexity of an occupation by performing Principal Component Analysis on a broad set of occupational descriptors in the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) data.We establish four main empirical facts for the U.S. over the 1980-2005 time period that are robust to the inclusion of a detailed set of controls, subsamples, and levels of aggregation: (1) There is a positive relationship across occupations between task complexity and wages and wage growth; (2) Conditional on task complexity, routine-intensity of an occupation is not a significant predictor of wage growth and wage levels; (3) Labor has reallocated from less complex to more complex occupations over time; (4) Within groups of occupations with similar task complexity labor has reallocated to non-routine occupations over time. We then formulate a model of Complex-Task Biased Technological Change with heterogeneous skills and show analytically that it can rationalize these facts. We conclude that workers in non-routine occupations with low ability of solving complex tasks are not shielded from the labor market effects of automatization.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/ifdp/2017/files/ifdp1192.pdf,fedgif:36955:original

A model of banknote discounts,"Weber, Warren E., Maziero, Pricila, Ales, Laurence, Carapella, Francesca",N/A,"Prior to 1863, state-chartered banks in the United States issued notes - dollar-denominated promises to pay specie to the bearer on demand. Although these notes circulated at par locally, they usually were quoted at a discount outside the local area. These discounts varied by both the location of the bank and the location where the discount was being quoted. Further, these discounts were asymmetric across locations, meaning that the discounts quoted in location A on the notes of banks in location B generally differed from the discounts quoted in location B on the notes of banks in location A. Also, discounts generally increased when banks suspended payments on their notes. In this paper we construct a random matching model to qualitatively match these facts about banknote discounts. To attempt to account for locational differences, the model has agents that come from two distinct locations. Each location also has bankers that can issue notes. Banknotes are accepted in exchange because banks are required to produce when a banknote is presented for redemption and their past actions are public information. Overall, the model delivers predictions consistent with the behavior of discounts.",http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/common/pub_detail.cfm?pb_autonum_id=1046,fedmwp:42399:original

Misinformation in Social Media: The Role of Verification Incentives,"Cisternas, Gonzalo, Vásquez, Jorge",N/A,"We develop a model of a platform featuring producers of fake news as well as users who can share content and verify it at a cost. Since users supply news to other users, their actions affect fake news prevalence and strategic complementarities can arise: high levels of verification can lead to low prevalence of fake content, in turn inducing more unverified sharing that sustains high levels of verification. Equilibria in this market then arise as intersection points between a standard supply curve and a novel correspondence that generalizes a demand function to account for the users’ strategic environment. Equilibria exhibiting more fake news production and diffusion can be consistent with higher user welfare due to the strong verification complementarities at play. We also quantify externalities associated with users affecting the average quality of news items in the platform and examine the effects on outcomes of (i) lowering verification costs, (ii) certifying verified content, and (iii) using algorithmic filters.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr1028.pdf,fednsr:94636

Mortgage lending in Boston: a response to the critics,"Tootell, Geoffrey M. B., Browne, Lynn E.",N/A,"Three years ago, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston released an examination of racial patterns in mortgage denial rates in the Boston area. The study was motivated by newly available data on mortgage applications, showing that black and Hispanic applicants were two to three times as likely to be turned down for mortgages as white applicants. The study gathered all the variables thought to be missing from the HMDA analysis, such as the applicants' debt burdens and credit histories, to see whether these economic factors explained the racial difference in denial rates. Although the additional information did explain much of the difference, after taking account of economic factors the applicant's race still significantly affected the probability of getting a mortgage.> The study has been influential and has caused many institutions to review their lending practices and supervisory agencies to alter their examination procedures. The study has also drawn criticism, with critics claiming that variables have been omitted, the model misspecified, errors made in the data, and information about racial differences in foreclosures ignored.

When the two rules cannot be satisfied simultaneously, which occurs in a large set of economies, optimal monetary policy achieves only the second best. The authors analyze when the second-best monetary policy exceeds the Friedman rule and when it obeys the Friedman rule. Furthermore, they extend the analysis to an economy with barter and show how the Hosios rule must be modified in order to internalize all search externalities.",https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-200408,fedcwp:39336:original

Should We Be Puzzled by Forward Guidance?,"Bundick, Brent, Smith, Andrew Lee",N/A,"Although a growing literature argues output is too sensitive to future interest rates in standard macroeconomic models, little empirical evidence has been put forth to evaluate this claim. In this paper, we use a range of vector autoregression models to answer the central question of how much output responds to changes in interest rate expectations following a monetary policy shock. Despite distinct identification strategies and sample periods, we find surprising agreement regarding this elasticity across empirical models. We then show that in a standard model of nominal rigidity estimated using impulse response matching, forward guidance shocks produce an elasticity of output with respect to expected interest rates similar to our empirical estimates. Our results suggest that standard macroeconomic models do not overstate the observed sensitivity of output to expected interest rates.",https://www.kansascityfed.org/documents/4285/Should_We_Be_Puzzled_by_Forward_Guidance.pdf,fedkrw:87883:original

The Roles of Price Points and Menu Costs in Price Rigidity,"Knotek, Edward S.",N/A,"Macroeconomic models often generate nominal price rigidity via menu costs. This paper provides empirical evidence that treating menu costs as a structural explanation for sticky prices may be spurious. Using scanner data, I note two empirical facts: (1) price points, embodied in nine-ending prices, account for approximately two-thirds of prices; and (2) at the conclusion of sales, post-sale prices return to their pre-sale levels more than three-fourths of the time. I construct a model that nests roles for menu costs and price points and estimate model variants. Excluding the two facts yields a statistically and economically significant role for menu costs in generating price rigidity. Incorporating the two facts yields an incentive to set nine-ending prices two orders of magnitude larger than the menu costs. In this setting, the price point model can match the two stylized facts, but menu costs are effectively irrelevant as a source of price rigidity. The choice of a mechanism for price rigidity matters for aggregate dynamics.",https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-201923,fedcwq:42331:original

Fiscal spending multipliers: evidence from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act,"Wilson, Daniel J.",N/A,"This paper estimates the ?jobs multiplier? of fiscal spending using the state-level allocations of federal stimulus funds from the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Specifically, I estimate the relationship between state-level federal ARRA spending and state employment outcomes from the time the Act was passed (February 2009) through the latest month of data (currently May 2010). Because actual state allocations of stimulus spending may be endogenous with respect to state economic outcomes, I instrument for stimulus spending using the state allocations that were anticipated immediately after the ARRA was passed, according to the Wall Street Journal and the Center for American Progress. To control for the counterfactual ? what would have happened without the stimulus ? I include several variables likely to be strong predictors of state employment growth. The results point to substantial heterogeneity in the impact of ARRA spending over time, across sectors, and across types of spending. The estimated jobs multiplier for total nonfarm employment is large and statistically significant for ARRA spending through March 2010, but falls considerably and becomes insignificant in April and May. The implied number of jobs created or saved by the spending is about 2.0 million as of March, but drops to 0.8 million as of May. Across sectors, the estimated impact of ARRA spending on construction employment is especially large, implying a 18.4% increase in employment (as of May 2010) relative to what it would have been without the ARRA. Lastly, I find that spending on infrastructure and other general purposes has a large positive impact, while spending on safety-net programs such as unemployment insurance and Medicaid reduces employment.",http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2010/wp10-17bk.pdf,fedfwp:8526:original
Does Disappointing European Productivity Growth Reflect a Slowing Trend? Weighing the Evidence and Assessing the Future,"Inklaar, Robert, Fernald, John G.",N/A,"In the years since the Great Recession, many observers have highlighted the slow pace of labor and total factor productivity (TFP) growth in advanced economies. This paper focuses on the European experience, where we highlight that trend TFP growth was already low in the runup to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). This suggests that it is important to consider factors other than just the deep crisis itself or policy changes since the crisis. After the mid-1990s, European economies stopped converging, or even began diverging, from the U.S. level of TFP. That said, in contrast to the United States, there is some macroeconomic evidence for some northern European countries that the GFC had a further adverse impact on TFP growth. Still, the challenges for economic policy look surprisingly similar to the ones discussed prior to the Great Recession, even if the policy implications seem less clear.",https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp2020-22.pdf,fedfwp:88300:original
Two practical algorithms for solving rational expectations models,"Brayton, Flint",N/A,"This paper describes the E-Newton and E-QNewton algorithms for solving rational expectations (RE) models. Both algorithms treat a model's RE terms as exogenous variables whose values are iteratively updated until they (hopefully) satisfy the RE requirement. In E-Newton, the updates are based on Newton's method; E-QNewton uses an efficient form of Broyden's quasi-Newton method. The paper shows that the algorithms are reliable, fast enough for practical use on a mid-range PC, and simple enough that their implementation does not require highly specialized software. The evaluation of the algorithms is based on experiments with three well-known macro models--the Smets-Wouters (SW) model, EDO, and FRB/US--using code written in EViews, a general-purpose, easy-to-use software package. The models are either linear (SW and EDO) or mildly nonlinear (FRB/US). A test of the robustness of the algorithms in the presence of substantial nonlinearity is based on modified versions of each model that include a smoothed form of the constraint that the short-term rate of interest cannot fall below zero. In two single-simulation experiments with the standard and modified versions of the models, E-QNewton is found to be faster than E-Newton, except for solutions of small-to-medium sized linear models. In a multi-simulation experiment using the standard versions of the models, E-Newton dominates E-QNewton.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2011/201144/201144abs.html,fedgfe:33910:original

The observed differential disappeared by 1992, suggesting improved market efficiency and/or the impact of FDICIA (1991), which mandated \""least-cost\"" resolution procedures for failed institutions. Additionally, the evidence suggests that bank branches are independent value objects whose auctions always result in \""unintended\"" transfers of value to the winning bidders. This result, while consistent with previous literature that found positive cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) to the winners of auctions for the branches of failed banks, nevertheless suggests that not all of the positive CARs can be due to market inefficiency.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/1997/199733/199733abs.html,fedgfe:34521:original

Pegging and stabilization policy in developing countries,"Moreno, Ramon",N/A,"I review the case for pegging the exchange rate by surveying the recent theoretical literature on the choice of exchange rate regimes.  This literature suggests that by enhancing the transparency or controllability of monetary policy, pegging may be more effective in lowering inflation expectations than other targets (such as money growth).  However, under certain conditions a peg may be vulnerable to shifts in expectations.  A peg also may require greater fiscal restraint by limiting the availability of inflation tax revenue; however, given certain economic distortions, policymakers may find it less costly to adopt expansionary fiscal policies under a peg than under a float.  Pegging may stimulate growth by enhancing international trade or investment.  However, it may reduce welfare by restricting the ability of policymakers to offset shocks.  I also examine how pegging is associated with inflation and output in a sample of developing countries using a new exchange rate classification method.  I find that a pegged exchange rate is associated with lower inflation and inflation volatility and with faster growth and similar output volatility.  However, the theoretical survey suggests that any inferences should be drawn with care.",https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/article2-3.pdf,fedfer:23477

The evolution of a financial crisis: panic in the asset-backed commercial paper market,"Liang, J. Nellie, Suarez, Gustavo A., Covitz, Daniel M.",N/A,"The $350 billion contraction in the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) market in the last five months of 2007 played a central role in transforming concerns about the credit quality of mortgage-related assets into a global financial crisis. This paper attempts to better understand why the substantial contraction in ABCP occurred by measuring and analyzing runs on ABCP programs over the period from August 2007 through December 2007. While it has been suggested that commercial paper programs, like commercial banks, may be prone to runs, we are the first to conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis of runs in the ABCP market using a rich and novel issue-level data set for all ABCP programs in the U.S. market. A program is defined as being run when it does not issue new paper during a week despite having a substantial share of its outstandings scheduled to mature, and then continuing in a run until it issues. We find evidence of extensive runs: more than 100 programs (one-third of all ABCP programs) were in a run within weeks of the onset of the turmoil and the odds of subsequently leaving the run state were very low. We interpret this finding as an indication that the ABCP market was subject to a bank-like \""panic.\"" We also find that while runs were linked to credit and liquidity exposures of individual programs, runs were also related importantly to non-program specific variables in the first several weeks of the turmoil, indicating that runs were relatively indiscriminate during the early part of the panic. Thus the ABCP market may be inherently unstable and a source of systemic risk.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2009/200936/200936abs.html,fedgfe:33684:original
Density selection and combination under model ambiguity: an application to stock returns,"D'Amico, Stefania",N/A,"This paper proposes a method for predicting the probability density of a variable of interest in the presence of model ambiguity. In the first step, each candidate parametric model is estimated minimizing the Kullback-Leibler 'distance' (KLD) from a reference nonparametric density estimate. Given that the KLD represents a measure of uncertainty about the true structure, in the second step, its information content is used to rank and combine the estimated models. The paper shows that the KLD between the nonparametric and the parametric density estimates is asymptotically normally distributed. This result leads to determining the weights in the model combination, using the distribution function of a Normal centered on the average performance of all plausible models. Consequently, the final weight is determined by the ability of a given model to perform better than the average. As such, this combination technique does not require the true structure to belong to the set of competing models and is computationally simple. I apply the proposed method to estimate the density function of daily stock returns under different phases of the business cycle. The results indicate that the double Gamma distribution is superior to the Gaussian distribution in modeling stock returns, and that the combination outperforms each individual candidate model both in- and out-of-sample.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2005/200509/200509abs.html,fedgfe:33820:original

Event studies examine the response of financial variables to a market-sensitive \\""surprise\\"" component using a narrow event window. The authors argue that these features - narrow event window and surprise component - can be easily embedded in common-factor models that study the real-time impact of macroeconomic announcements on key policy variables such as inflation or gross domestic product growth. Demonstrative applications are provided for Swiss inflation that show that (i) the communication of monetary policy announcements generates an asymmetric response for inflation forecasts, (ii) the pass-through effect of import price releases on inflation forecasts is weak, and (iii) macroeconomic releases of real and nominal variables generate nonsynchronized effects for inflation forecasts.",https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/09/09/part2/Amstad.pdf,fedlrv:26052

Does income inequality lead to consumption equality? evidence and theory,"Perri, Fabrizio, Krueger, Dirk",N/A,"Using data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey, we first document that the recent increase in income inequality in the United States has not been accompanied by a corresponding rise in consumption inequality. Much of this divergence is due to different trends in within-group inequality, which has increased significantly for income but little for consumption. We then develop a simple framework that allows us to analytically characterize how within-group income inequality affects consumption inequality in a world in which agents can trade a full set of contingent consumption claims, subject to endogenous constraints emanating from the limited enforcement of intertemporal contracts (as in Kehoe and Levine, 1993). Finally, we quantitatively evaluate, in the context of a calibrated general equilibrium production economy, whether this setup, or alternatively a standard incomplete markets model (as in Aiyagari, 1994), can account for the documented stylized consumption inequality facts from the U.S. data.",http://minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr363.pdf,fedmsr:4770
Optimal Progressivity with Age-Dependent Taxation,"Violante, Giovanni L., Heathcote, Jonathan, Storesletten, Kjetil",N/A,"This paper studies optimal taxation of labor earnings when the degree of tax progressivity is allowed to vary with age. We analyze this question in a tractable equilibrium overlapping-generations model that incorporates a number of salient trade-offs in tax design. Tax progressivity provides insurance against ex-ante heterogeneity and earnings uncertainty that missing markets fail to deliver. However, taxes distort labor supply and human capital investments. Uninsurable risk cumulates over the life cycle, and thus the welfare gains from income compression via progressive taxation increase with age. On the other hand, average labor productivity rises with age, and thus the welfare losses from progressive taxation's distortionary impact on labor supply also increase with age. The optimal age-varying system balances these distortions. In a calibrated version of the economy, we quantify the welfare gains of moving from the optimal age-invariant to the optimal age-dependent system and find that they are negligible.",https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr551.pdf,fedmsr:4937

The Dynamics of the Smoking Wage Penalty,"Hotchkiss, Julie L., Darden, Michael, Pitts, M. Melinda",N/A,"Cigarette smokers earn significantly less than nonsmokers, but the magnitude of the smoking wage gap and the pathways by which it originates are unclear. Proposed mechanisms often focus on spot differences in employee productivity or employer preferences, neglecting the dynamic nature of human capital development and addiction. In this paper, we formulate a dynamic model of young workers as they transition from schooling to the labor market, a period in which the lifetime trajectory of wages is being developed. We estimate the model with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 Cohort, and we simulate the model under counterfactual scenarios that isolate the contemporaneous effects of smoking from dynamic differences in human capital accumulation and occupational selection. Results from our preferred model, which accounts for unobserved heterogeneity in the joint determination of smoking, human capital, labor supply, and wages, suggest that continued heavy smoking in young adulthood results in a wage penalty at age 30 of 14.8 percent and 9.3 percent for women and men, respectively. These differences are less than half of the raw mean difference in wages at age 30. We show that the contemporaneous effect of heavy smoking net of any life-cycle effects explains roughly 67 percent of the female smoking wage gap but only 11 percent of the male smoking wage gap.",https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/wp/2020/07/28/11-dynamics-of-smoking-wage-penalty.pdf,fedawp:88477:original

We show that inequality started to increase for men in 1974, and for women in 1981, and for both genders inequality continued to increase throughout 2002. During the same period the wage premium of college graduates over non-college workers increased substantially and the ratio of college educated workers to non-college workers also increased. These facts support the popular skill-biased technical change (SBTC) hypothesis. However, other facts raise some doubts about the SBTC hypothesis. First, the college wage premium is mainly due to workers with a postgraduate degree, but their increase in the labor force started much earlier than the spectacular rise in their wages. Also there has been no marked change in recent decades in the occupational distribution of workers. However, the earning premium of professional over blue collar workers followed the same trend as the college earning premium.

Property tax limits and local fiscal behavior: did Massachusetts cities and towns spend too little on town services under proposition 2 1/2?,"Bradbury, Katharine L.",N/A,"This paper examines the impact of a specific local tax limit, Proposition 2 in Massachusetts, on the fiscal behavior of cities and towns in Massachusetts and the capitalization of that behavior into property values. Proposition 2 places a cap on the effective property tax rate at 2.5 percent and limits nominal annual growth in property tax revenues to 2.5 percent, unless residents pass a referendum (an override) allowing a greater increase. The study analyzes the 1990-94 period, a time when Massachusetts municipalities faced significant fiscal stress because of a 30 percent cut in real estate aid and a demographically driven increase in school enrollments. The findings include the following: (1) Proposition 2 significantly constrained local spending in some communities; (2) constrained communities realized gains in property values to the degree that they were able to increase school spending despite the limitation; and (3) changes in school spending were a much stronger influence on house price changes than were changes in nonschool spending. These findings are confirmed using several different econometric approaches, including a two-stage technique that directly estimates how close each community's spending was to what it would have been in the absence of Proposition 2.",http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp1997/wp97_2.htm,fedbwp:7327:original

Relationship loans and information exploitability in a competitive market: loan commitments vs. spot loans,"Ergungor, O. Emre",N/A,"Despite the numerous benefits of loan commitments, only 79% of the commercial and industrial loans are made under commitment. I show that two factors limit the use of loan commitments. First, because banks commit themselves to lend, they carry costly liquidity reserves to meet their obligations. Due to liquidity costs, the interest rate on commitment loans is high relative to spot loans. Second, high interest rates trigger moral hazard. If the bank expects a profitable relationship in the future, it can absorb a portion of the liquidity costs to reduce the interest rate and attenuate moral hazard. If not, the borrower cannot get a loan commitment.",https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-200013,fedcwp:39951:original
Another strong year for the Eleventh District,"Sigalla, Fiona",N/A,"The Eleventh District marked its eighth year of economic expansion in 1994. Employment grew strongly in all three Eleventh District states- Louisiana, New Mexico, and Texas. Although the past prominence of the oil and gas sector is well-known, in 1994 the region prospered despite continued declines in the energy industry. A robust U.S. economy stimulated demand for District manufacturing and service industries, which helped drive the economy. ; Fiona Sigalla surveys the 1994 performance of the Eleventh District economy and finds that a favorable business climate and expanding trade in goods and services to Mexico helped the Eleventh District grow faster than the nation. While slower economic growth in the United States and uncertainty in Mexico will be drags on the District economy in the year ahead, 1995 should be another good year for District states.",https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/research/er/1995/er9501d.pdf,fedder:5217

Why did Europe’s productivity catch-up sputter out? a tale of tigers and tortoises,"Dew-Becker, Ian, Gordon, Robert J.",N/A,"This paper takes a different approach to examining the sharp turnaround in EU relative to U. S. labor productivity growth since 1995. The vast majority of the literature focuses on the American growth revival. But close to half of the turnaround was caused by a European retardation. What caused that retardation? Our paper shows that none of the consensus explanations of the American revival provide any help at all in explaining the European retardation. It is sui generis and therein lies a tale that has not previously been told. ; Europe has faltered across the board. The deceleration of its productivity growth is not explained at all by ICT production and only to a small degree by retailing/wholesaling. Rather, the big European countries have failed in nearly every dimension. The retardation of Europe is illuminated by dividing up the EU-15 countries into Tigers, a Middle group, and Tortoises. ; Our first surprise in examining the data is to find that the EU-US turnaround in labor productivity growth was not just a reflection of an equivalent turnaround in total factor productivity growth. Capital deepening also faltered in Europe, indicting all the macroeconomic determinants of economy-wide investment as part of Europe?s problem. ; The most striking aspect of our results is that the failing of the Tortoise countries is widespread, spanning industries as diverse as agriculture, wholesale trade, mining, chemicals, construction, fabricated metals, and clothing. Our explanation is that Europe?s previous catch-up to the U. S. productivity level before 1995 was artificial ? by making labor expensive, Europe raised its average product. But after 1995 as labor market reforms have helped to make labor cheaper, so the average product of labor has been pushed down and its growth rate has faltered. The falling behind of Europe is quite simple to explain; European regulations defied the laws of labor market equilibrium for decades, and a slight leak in the dam holding back market forces has already led to faster growth in European employment and slower growth in productivity.",https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/1_ProductivityCatchup.pdf,fedfpr:28248

Tax distortions in a neoclassical monetary economy,"Hansen, Gary D., Cooley, Thomas F.",N/A,"In this paper we use the common perspective provided by the neoclassical growth model to evaluate the size of the distortions associated with different monetary and fiscal policies designed to finance a given sequence of government expenditures. We construct an artificial monetary economy incorporating the cash-in-advance framework of Lucas and Stokey (1983), calibrate it to match important features of the U.S. economy, and simulate it to provide a quantitative assessment of the welfare costs associated with government policies involving different combinations of taxes on capital and labor income, consumption, and holdings of money. In particular, we evaluate the welfare gains from tax reforms that are designed to replace taxes on capital or labor income with other forms of taxation. Our results suggest that the welfare costs of financing a given sequence of government expenditures are slightly lower in economies that substitute inflation or consumption taxes for the tax on labor income, but dramatically lower for economies that substitute any of these taxes for the tax on capital income. Replacing the capital tax with a consumption tax, for example, eliminates 81 percent of the welfare cost arising from distorting taxation. In addition, we show that these welfare costs can be reduced further by eliminating the capital tax with a nonstationary policy that involves a transition to a temporary policy followed by a new steady state policy rather than an immediate change to a new steady state policy.",https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/dp/dp38.pdf,fedmem:38924

Lifecycle Patterns of Saving and Wealth Accumulation,"Sabelhaus, John Edward, Feiveson, Laura",N/A,"Empirical analysis of U.S. income, saving and wealth dynamics is constrained by a lack of high-quality and comprehensive household-level panel data. This paper uses a pseudo-panel approach, tracking types of agents by birth cohort and across time through a series of cross-section snapshots synthesized with macro aggregates. The key micro source data is the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which captures the top of the wealth distribution by sampling from administrative records. The SCF has the detailed balance sheet components, incomes, and interfamily transfers needed to use both sides of the intertemporal budget constraint and thus solve for saving and consumption. The results here are consistent with recent papers based on individual panel data from countries with administrative registries, and highlights the different roles of saving, capital gains, and interfamily transfers in wealth change over the lifecycle and across permanent income groups.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019010pap.pdf,fedgfe:35305:original
Monetary policy rules and the Great Inflation,"Orphanides, Athanasios",N/A,"The nature of monetary policy during the 1970s is evaluated through the lens of a forward-looking Taylor rule based on perceptions regarding the outlook for inflation and unemployment at the time policy decisions were made. The evidence suggests that policy during the 1970s was essentially indistinguishable from a systematic, activist, forward-looking approach such as is often identified with good policy advice in theoretical and econometric policy evaluation research. This points to the unpleasant possibility that the policy errors of the 1970s occurred despite the use of a seemingly desirable policy approach. Though the resulting activist policies could have appeared highly promising, they proved, in retrospect, counterproductive.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2002/200208/200208abs.html,fedgfe:35396:original

Anchored or Not: How Much Information Does 21st Century Data Contain on Inflation Dynamics?,"Kiley, Michael T.",N/A,"Inflation was low and stable in the United States during the first two decades of the 21st century and broke out of its stable range in 2021.  Experience in the early 21st century differed from that of the second half of the 20th century, when inflation showed persistent movements including the ""Great Inflation""  of the 1970s.  This analysis examines the extent to which the experience from 2000-2019 should lead a Bayesian decisionmaker to update their assessment of inflation dynamics.  Given a prior for inflation dynamics consistent with 1960-1999 data, a Bayesian decisionmaker would not update their view of inflation persistence in light of 2000-2019 data unless they placed very low weight on their prior information.  In other words, 21st century data contains very little information to dissuade a Bayesian decisionmaker of the view that inflation fluctuations are persistent, or ""unanchored"" .  The intuition for, and implications of, this finding are discussed.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2022016pap.pdf,fedgfe:93919:original
Cross-border returns differentials,"Curcuru, Stephanie E., Dvorak, Tomas, Warnock, Francis E.",N/A,"Were the U.S. to persistently earn substantially more on its foreign investments (\""U.S. claims\"") than foreigners earn on their U.S. investments (\""U.S. liabilities\""), the likelihood that the current environment of sizeable global imbalances will evolve in a benign manner increases. However, using a monthly dataset on the foreign equity and bond portfolios of U.S. investors and the U.S. equity and bond portfolios of foreign investors, we find that the returns differential for portfolio securities is near zero, far smaller than previously reported. Examining all U.S. claims and liabilities (portfolio securities as well as direct investment and banking), we find that previous estimates of large differentials are biased upward. The bias owes to computing implied returns from an internally inconsistent dataset of revised data; original data produce a much smaller differential. We also attempt to reconcile our finding of a near zero returns differential with observed patterns of cumulated current account deficits, the net international investment position, and the net income balance. Overall, we find no evidence that the U.S. can count on earning substantially more on its claims than it pays on its liabilities.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2008/921/default.htm,fedgif:37182:original

As this literature has expanded at a rapid pace, it has become increasingly difficult for mainstream economists to understand the differences between alternative oil market models, let alone the basis for the sometimes divergent conclusions reached in the literature. The purpose of this survey is to provide a guide to this literature. Our focus is on the econometric foundations of the analysis of oil market models with special attention to the identifying assumptions and methods of inference. We not only explain how the workhorse models in this literature have evolved, but also examine alternative oil market VAR models. We help the reader understand why the latter models sometimes generated unconventional, puzzling or erroneous conclusions. Finally, we discuss the construction of extraneous measures of oil demand and oil supply shocks that have been used as external or internal instruments for VAR models.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2020/wp2006.pdf,feddwp:87676:original

Although inventories are an important element of the model's propagation mechanism, shocks to inventory efficiency or management are not an important source of business cycles.

However, the slow adjustment of rates that banks pay on deposits may result in people moving their savings, leading to a reallocation of assets away from the regulated banking system.",https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/el2022-35.pdf,fedfel:95347
Macroeconomic behavior during periods of speculative pressure or realignment: evidence from Pacific Basin economies,"Moreno, Ramon",N/A,"This paper uses nonparametric tests to provide a description of the \""stylized facts\"" associated with episodes of speculative  pressure in foreign exchange markets in Pacific Basin Economies and to see whether these \""stylized facts\"" appear to be broadly consistent with the alternative explanations for such episodes suggested in the theoretical literature. ; The empirical results are mixed, but some are nonetheless suggestive. Larger budget deficits and growth in central bank domestic credit appear to be associated with episodes of depreciation rather than episodes of appreciation or periods of tranquility, indicating that unusually expansionary or contractionary policies may contribute to speculative pressures in foreign exchange markets.  There also is some evidence that episodes of speculative pressure may arise when economic conditions make it costly for the government to maintain a stable exchange rate.",https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/econrev.-22.pdf,fedfer:23109

"Capital-labor substitution, equilibrium indeterminacy, and the cyclical behavior of labor income","Guo, Jang-Ting, Lansing, Kevin J.",N/A,"This paper examines the quantitative relationship between the elasticity of capital-labor substitution and the conditions needed for equilibrium indeterminacy (and belief-driven fluctuations) in a one-sector neoclassical growth model. Our analysis employs a ?normalized? version of the CES production function so that all steady-state allocations and factor income shares are held constant as the elasticity of substitution is varied. We demonstrate numerically that higher elasticities cause the threshold degree of increasing returns for indeterminacy to decline monotonically, albeit very gradually. When the elasticity of substitution is unity (the Cobb-Douglas case), our model requires increasing returns to scale of around 1.08 for indeterminacy. When the elasticity of substitution is raised to 5, which far exceeds any empirical estimate, the threshold degree of increasing returns reduces to around 1.05. We also demonstrate analytically that labor?s share of income becomes procyclical as the elasticity of substitution increases above unity, whereas labor?s share in postwar U.S. data is countercyclical. This observation, together with other empirical evidence, indicates that the elasticity of capital-labor substitution in the U.S. economy is actually below unity.",http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2008/wp08-06bk.pdf,fedfwp:8725:original
Price Setting in an Innovative Market,"Shapiro, Adam Hale, Copeland, Adam",N/A,"We examine how the confluence of competition and upstream innovation influences downstream firms? profit-maximizing strategies. In particular, we analyze how, in light of these forces, the downstream firm sets the price of the product over its life cycle. We focus on personal computers (PCs) and introduce two novel data sets that describe prices and sales in the industry. Our main result is that a vintage-capital model that combines a competitive market structure with a rapid rate of innovation is well able to explain the observed paths of prices, as well as sales and consumer income, over a typical PC?s product cycle. The analysis implies that rapid price declines are not caused by upstream innovation alone, but rather by the combination of upstream innovation and a competitive environment.",http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/papers/2013/wp2013-04.pdf,fedfwp:8828:original

Is Free College the Solution to Student Debt Woes? Studying the Heterogeneous Impacts of Merit Aid Programs,"Chakrabarti, Rajashri, Nober, William, Van der Klaauw, Wilbert",N/A,"The rising cost of a college education has become an important topic of discussion among both policymakers and practitioners. At least eleven states have recently introduced programs to make public two-year education tuition free, including New York, which is rolling out its Excelsior Scholarship to provide tuition-free four-year college education to low-income students across the SUNY and CUNY systems. Prior to these new initiatives, New York, had already instituted merit scholarship programs that subsidize the cost of college conditional on academic performance and in-state attendance. Given the rising cost of college and the increased prevalence of tuition-subsidy programs, it?s important for us to understand the effects of such programs on students, and whether these effects vary by income and race. While a rich body of work has studied the effects of merit scholarship programs on educational attainment, the same is not true for the effects on financial outcomes of students, such as debt and repayment.

Does trading frequency affect subordinated debt spreads?,"Hancock, Diana, Kawano, Laura, Bianchi, Christopher",N/A,"Because illiquid bonds may be relatively poorly priced, the ability to infer investor perceptions of changes in a banking organization's financial health from such bonds may be obscured. To examine the time-series effect of trading frequency on subordinated debt spreads, we consider the liquidity of subordinated debt for large, complex U.S. banking organizations over the 1987:Q2 - 2002:Q4 period. Since trade volumes are unobservable, we construct various measures of weekly trading frequency from observed bond prices. Using these indirect liquidity measures, we find evidence that trading frequency does significantly affect observed subordinated debt spreads.

We argue that the relationship between their withholding preference and portfolio allocation across liquid and illiquid assets is consistent with models with present-biased preferences, and that individuals exhibit self-control problems when making their consumption and saving decisions. Our results support a model in which individuals use commitment devices to constrain their consumption. Using data on other tax-filing behaviors, we also show that mental accounting and loss aversion explanations for tax filers' \""preference for over-withholding\"" are unlikely to explain the patterns in the data. Present-biasedness and dynamic inconsistency among LMI tax filers have important implications for saving policies and tax administration.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2008/200811/200811abs.html,fedgfe:34548:original
Fiscal Multipliers at the Zero Lower Bound: The Role of Policy Inertia,"Nakata, Taisuke, Hills, Timothy S.",N/A,"The presence of the lagged shadow policy rate in the interest rate feedback rule reduces the government spending multiplier nontrivially when the policy rate is constrained at the zero lower bound (ZLB). In the economy with policy inertia, increased inflation and output due to higher government spending during a recession speed up the return of the policy rate to the steady state after the recession ends. This in turn dampens the expansionary effects of the government spending during the recession via expectations. In our baseline calibration, the output multiplier at the ZLB is 2.5 when the weight on the lagged shadow rate is zero, and 1.1 when the weight is 0.9.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2014/files/2014107pap.pdf,fedgfe:35682:original

Housing busts and household mobility,"Gyourko, Joseph, Ferreira, Fernando, Tracy, Joseph",N/A,"Using two decades of American Housing Survey data from 1985 to 2005, we estimate the influence of negative home equity and rising mortgage interest rates on household mobility. We find that both factors lead to lower, not higher, mobility rates over time. The effects are economically large -- mobility is almost 50 percent lower for owners with negative equity in their homes. This finding does not imply that current concerns over defaults and homeowners having to relocate are entirely misplaced. It does indicate that, in the past, the mortgage lock-in effects of these two factors were dominant over time. Policymakers may wish to begin considering the consequences of mortgage lock-in and reduced household mobility because they are quite different from the consequences associated with default and higher mobility.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr350.html,fednsr:12050
Rational speculators and exchange rate volatility,"Osler, Carol L., Carlson, John A.",N/A,"This paper examines whether rational, fully informed speculators will smooth exchange rates. Friedman's (1953) claim that they must do so is challenged, based on the exclusion of interest rate differentials from his interpretation of speculator behavior. Once one recognizes that interest rates matter to speculators, it becomes apparent that rational speculators could sometimes violate Friedman's description of their behavior, and buy currency when its value is relatively high or sell currency when its value is low. For this reason the presence of rational, fully informed speculators may increase exchange rate volatility under floating exchange rates. Whether or not speculators increase exchange rate volatility depends on the extent of speculative activity and the types of economic shocks that dominate. At low levels of speculative activity, speculation will be stabilizing when the dominant shocks to exchange rates are associated exclusively with real economic activity, such as international trade in goods and services. It becomes destabilizing when the dominant shocks are changes in interest rates, perceived risk, or transactions costs--factors whose influence on exchange rates derives in part from their direct effect on speculators' positions.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr13.pdf,fednsr:12352

"Liquidity Regulations, Bank Lending, and Fire-Sale Risk","Shachar, Or, Sarkar, Asani, Roberts, Daniel",N/A,"We examine whether U.S. banks subject to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) reduce lending (an unintended consequence) and/or become more resilient to liquidity shocks, as intended by regulators. We find that LCR banks tighten lending standards, and reduce liquidity creation that occurs mainly through lower lending relative to non-LCR banks. However, covered banks also contribute less to fire-sale externalities relative to exempt banks. For LCR banks, we estimate that the total after-tax benefits of reduced fire-sale risk (net of the costs associated with foregone lending) exceed $50 billion from second-quarter 2013 to 2017, mostly accruing to the largest LCR banks. Non-LCR regulations enacted during our sample period cannot fully account for these findings. For the banking sector as a whole, lending migrates to smaller, non-LCR banks so that lending shares increase but fire-sale risk does not decrease. Our results highlight the trade-off between liquidity creation and resiliency arising from liquidity regulations that underlie the debate on whether the LCR should be extended following the banking crisis of March 2023.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr852.pdf,fednsr:12589

Using the monthly stock returns of 1,808 firms located in 43 countries but traded in London between 1866 and 1907, we estimate the country-specific cost of capital. We find a negative relationship between institutions that protect property rights and capital costs. Firms located in countries with weak institutions were charged a premium compared to similarly risky firms located in countries with strong institutions, and this penalty appeared to be costly in terms of future growth. Countries that paid a premium for borrowing in London during this period grew more slowly after 1913 and are poorer today.

In this paper we build an applied general equilibrium model and incorporate the population projections made by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to evaluate the macroeconomic and welfare implications of alternative fiscal responses to the retirement of the baby- boomers. Our calculation suggest that it will be costly to maintain the benefits at the levels now promised because the increases in distortionary taxes required to finance those benefits will reduce private saving and labor supply. We also find that the ?accounting calculations? made by SSA underestimate the required fiscal adjustments.

Central bank intervention and the volatility of foreign exchange rates: evidence from the options market,"Bonser-Neal, Catherine, Tanner, Glenn",N/A,"This paper tests the effects of central bank intervention on the ex ante volatility of $/DM and $/Yen exchange rates. In contrast to previous research which employed GARCH estimates of conditional volatility, we estimate ex ante volatility using the implied volatilities of currency options prices. We also control for the effects of other macroeconomic announcements. We find little support for the hypothesis that central bank intervention decreased expected exchange rate volatility between 1985 and 1991. Federal Reserve intervention was generally associated with a positive change in exante $/DM and $/Yen volatility, or with no change. Perceived Bundesbank intervention did not alter $/DM ex ante volatility in any of the periods, while perceived Bank of Japan intervention was associated with positive changes in ex ante $/Yen volatility during the 1985-91 period as a whole and during the February 1987 to December 1989 post-Louvre Accord subperiod.",,fedkrw:40664:original

To analyze such a policy, I build a model with three key features: 1) bank panics can occur in equilibrium, 2) there can be moral hazard, 3) the central bank can create money which is willingly held. I show that a particular central bank repurchase policy provides liquidity to the banking system and can prevent bank panics without moral hazard problems.

Is the Middle Class Worse Off Than It Used to Be?,"Fallick, Bruce, Dohrman, Emily",N/A,"We analyze how median real incomes in the United States have changed since 1980 under a definition of the middle class that adjusts for changes in demographics. We find that failing to adjust for demographic shifts in the population relating to age, race, and education can indicate a more positive outlook than is truly the case. We also find that the real median incomes of today’s middle class are somewhat higher than they used to be, particularly for households headed by two adults. We find, as in prior research, that prices for housing, healthcare, and education have risen more than middle-class incomes, while prices for transportation, food, and recreation have risen less than middle-class incomes.",https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-ec-202003,fedcec:87457

"Fiscal deficits, debt, and monetary policy in a liquidity trap","Devereux, Michael B.",N/A,"The macroeconomic response to the economic crisis has revived old debates about the usefulness of monetary and fiscal policy in fighting recessions. Without the ability to further lower interest rates, policy authorities in many countries have turned to expansionary fiscal policies. Recent literature argues that government spending may be very effective in such environments. But a critical element of the stimulus packages in all countries was the use of deficit financing and tax reductions. This paper explores the role of government debt and deficits in an economy constrained by the zero bound on nominal interest rates. Given that the liquidity trap is generated by a large increase in the desire to save on the part of the private sector, the wealth effects of government deficits can provide a critical macroeconomic response to this. Government spending financed by deficits may be far more expansionary than that financed by tax increases in such an environment. In a liquidity trap, tax cuts may be much more effective than during normal times. Finally, monetary policies aimed at directly increasing monetary aggregates may be effective, even if interest rates are unchanged.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/international/wpapers/2010/0044.pdf,feddgw:14519:original

The Contribution of Jump Activity and Sign to Forecasting Stock Price Volatility,"Hizmeri, Rodrigo, Bu, Ruijun, Murphy, Anthony, Tsionas, Mike G., Izzeldin, Marwan",N/A,"This paper proposes a novel approach to decompose realized jump measures by type of activity (finite/infinite) and by sign. We also provide noise-robust versions of the ABD jump test (Andersen et al. 2007) and realized semivariance measures for use at high frequency sampling intervals. The volatility forecasting exercise involves the use of different types of jumps, forecast horizons, sampling frequencies, calendar and transaction time-based sampling schemes, as well as standard and noise-robust volatility measures. We find that infinite (finite) jumps improve the forecasts at shorter (longer) horizons; but the contribution of signed jumps is limited. Noise-robust estimators, that identify jumps in the presence of microstructure noise, deliver substantial forecast improvements at higher sampling frequencies. However, standard volatility measures at the 300-second frequency generate the smallest MSPEs. Since no single model dominates across sampling frequency and forecast horizon, we show that model averaged volatility forecasts - using time-varying weights and models from the model confidence set - generally outperform forecasts from both the benchmark and single best extended HAR model.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2019/wp1902r1.pdf,feddwp:27709:89122
"FinTech Lending, Social Networks and the Transmission of Monetary Policy","Zhou, Xiaoqing",N/A,"One of the main channels through which monetary policy stimulus affects the real economy is mortgage borrowing. This channel, however, is weakened by frictions in the mortgage market. The rapid growth of financial technology-based (FinTech) lending tends to ease these frictions, given the higher quality services provided under this new lending model. This paper establishes that the role of FinTech lending in the monetary policy transmission is further amplified by consumers’ social networks. I provide empirical evidence for this network effect using county-level data and novel identification strategies. A 1 pp increase in the FinTech market share in a county’s socially connected markets raises the county’s FinTech market share by 0.23-0.26 pps. Moreover, I find that in counties where FinTech market penetration is high, the pass-through of market interest rates to borrowers is more complete. To quantify the role of FinTech lending and its network propagation in the transmission of monetary policy shocks, I build a multi-region heterogeneous-agent model with social learning that embodies key features of FinTech lending. The model shows that the responses of consumption and refinancing to a monetary stimulus are 13% higher in the presence of FinTech lending. Almost half of this improvement is accounted for by FinTech propagation through social networks.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/papers/2022/wp2203.pdf,feddwp:93889:original

Imperfect Substitutability in Real Estate Markets and the Effect of Housing Demand on the Macroeconomy,"Davis, J. Scott, Sapci, Ayse, Huang, Kevin X. D.",N/A,"Changes in housing demand can have a macroeconomic effect through the collateral channel, where the change in residential real estate prices is associated with a change in commercial real estate prices, affecting firm collateral and thus firm investment. We argue that this channel is weaker when residential and commercial real estate are poor substitutes. Using cross-state heterogeneity in the strength of zoning regulations as a proxy for heterogeneity in the substitutability of residential and commercial real estate, we first show with firm level data that the strength of local zoning regulations has a negative effect on the estimated increase in firm investment following an increase in local residential real estate prices. We then construct a DSGE model where land has both residential and commercial uses and estimate it using Bayesian techniques and U.S. macroeconomic data. We find the average elasticity of substitution between commercial and residential real estate in the U.S. to be around 0.35, but in states with strong zoning restrictions it can be as low as 0.16 and in states with weak zoning restrictions it can be as high as 0.66. Simulations of the model show how these differences in zoning restrictions can affect the transmission of a housing demand shock to the macroeconomy.",https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/institute/wpapers/2020/0401.pdf,feddgw:88828:original

Measurement errors in Japanese Consumer Price Index,"Shiratsuka, Shigenori",N/A,"In Japan, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is widely used as a measure of inflation or the cost of living. The CPI is constructed by using a fixed-weight Laspeyres formula. This formula is used mainly because of its ease of calculation and comprehension, thus limiting the total cost of constructing the statistics. However, such simplicity makes it difficult for the CPI to reflect dynamic changes in economic activity such as changes in consumers' behavior between goods in response to relative price fluctuation, the introduction of new goods, and the disappearance of old goods. As a result, measurement errors are introduced into the CPI. In this paper, I summarize the problems pertaining to measurement errors inherent in the Japanese CPI, and provide some quantitative assessment. Based on currently available information, I place the point estimate for overall bias in the CPI at about 0.90 percentage point per year. Although this is the best estimate taking into account all information currently available, it is true that the estimate was based on various, rather bold assumptions. In addition, it should be noted that accuracy of the estimate is not necessarily high due to the lack of existing studies in this field in Japan.",http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/1999/wp99_02.pdf,fedhwp:6413:original

Forecasting disconnected exchange rates,"Berge, Travis J.",N/A,"Catalyzed by the work of Meese and Rogoff (1983), a large literature has documented the inability of empirical models to accurately forecast exchange rates out-of-sample. This paper extends the literature by introducing an empirical strategy that endogenously builds forecast models from a broad set of conventional exchange rate signals. The method is extremely flexible, allowing for potentially nonlinear models for each currency and forecast horizon that evolve over time. Analysis of the models selected by the procedure sheds light on the erratic behavior of exchange rates and their apparent disconnect from macroeconomic fundamentals. In terms of forecast ability, the Meese-Rogoff result remains intact. At short horizons, the method cannot outperform a random walk, although at longer horizons the method does outperform the random walk null. These findings are found consistently across currencies and forecast evaluation methods.",https://www.kansascityfed.org/documents/5298/pdf-rwp11-12.pdf,fedkrw:40934:original

A more equitable approach to cutting state aid,"Coyne, David, Zhao, Bo",N/A,"Local governments in New England rely on state aid to finance the provision of essential public services. Yet in response to the recent and ongoing fiscal crisis, state governments across the region have cut local aid deeply, often by the same percentage in each community. This across-the-board approach ignores differences in underlying local fiscal health and places a larger burden on many resource-poor communities. To address this concern, this policy brief provides a new, more equitable approach that allocates smaller aid cuts to communities that are in worse underlying fiscal health and received less existing aid. We use a ?need-capacity gap? to represent underlying fiscal health, which is measured based on local economic and social characteristics outside the direct control of local officials. While we use Massachusetts data on non-school aid to conduct policy simulations, the approach is applicable to many states and aid categories. ; This summarizes the NEPPC working paper 11-2: Designing Formulas for Distributing Reductions in State Aid.",http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/neppc/briefs/2011/briefs112.pdf,fedbbr:40369

Unemployment insurance policy in New England: background and issues,"Tannenwald, Robert, O'Leary, Christopher J.",N/A,"Almost two-thirds of the states, and all the New England states except New Hampshire, have exhausted their unemployment insurance trust fund and borrowed from the federal government at least once during the past 35 years. Under such circumstances, states are required by law to raise unemployment insurance taxes in order to replenish their trust funds and to pay off their debts to the federal government. Since higher unemployment insurance taxes increase employer costs, replenishment forces states into a trade-off between economic competitiveness and trust fund adequacy. In recent years, intensifying competitive pressures have caused many policymakers to question prevailing standards of adequacy and the speed at which they should be attained. Consequently, several states, including some still in the process of rebuilding reserves depleted by the last recession, are contemplating tax reductions.> This article provides background information and analysis intended to clarify issues underlying the unemployment insurance policies of New England in general and a tax reduction under consideration in Massachusetts in particular. The author's main point is that alternative unemployment insurance policies should not be judged solely by the yardsticks of economic competitiveness and trust fund adequacy.

Price equalization does not imply free trade,"Riezman, Raymond, Ravikumar, B., Sposi, Michael, Mutreja, Piyusha",N/A,"In this paper we show that price equalization alone is not sufficient to establish that there are no barriers to international trade. There are many barrier combinations that deliver price equalization, but each combination implies a different volume of trade. Therefore, in order to make statements about trade barriers it is necessary to know the trade flows. We demonstrate this first theoretically in a simple two-country model. We then extend the result quantitatively to a multicountry model with two sectors. We show that for the case of capital goods trade, barriers have to be large in order to be consistent with the observed trade flows. Our model also implies that capital goods prices look similar across countries, an implication that is consistent with data. Zero barriers to trade in capital goods will deliver price equalization in capital goods, but cannot reproduce the observed trade flows in our model.",http://www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/institute/wpapers/2012/0129.pdf,feddgw:14281:original
Sovereign debt restructurings and the IMF: implications for future official interventions,"Erce, Aitor",N/A,"This paper studies the role played by the IMF during sovereign debt restructurings and extracts lessons for future official interventions. To do so, I compare twelve recent debt restructurings. I begin by detailing the main features (?restructuring strategies?) of each episode. I then analyze the involvement of the Fund and relate it to the above-cited strategies. Despite the wide heterogeneity both in restructuring strategies and in the scope of IMF?s involvement, the Fund exerted a substantial influence. This influence came, not only through the provision of official finance and by setting an adjustment path through conditionality, but also by providing independent information and influencing countries? decisions to restructure by providing incentives both to creditors and debtors. My conclusion is that the flexibility that has characterized the role of the IMF so far might have exacerbated uncertainty and induced undesirable strategies from debtors and creditors alike. Thus, the international community could benefit from granting the IMF a more standardized operational role, reducing gambling for resurrection strategies and fostering fairness. Along these lines, I present ideas for reframing the IMF?s engagement in sovereign debt restructurings.",https://www.dallasfed.org/-/media/documents/research/international/wpapers/2013/0143.pdf,feddgw:14477:original

An Evening with Patrick Harker,"Harker, Patrick T.",N/A,"During a presentation at New Jersey’s Rowan Institute for Public Policy & Citizenship, Philadelphia Fed President and CEO Patrick Harker said that while inflation remains above target, “real progress is being made,” and “the runway at our destination is in sight” for a soft landing. Harker also underscored the importance of weighing hard and soft data and noted that the Fed’s “work cannot be limited to the financial sector and monetary policy alone.” Since decisions the Fed makes have an impact on communities, he said: “My goal — our goal — must be for the Philadelphia Fed to be seen as an active partner and participant in the economic life and futures of these communities.”",https://philadelphiafed-prod-cm.ase3.p.azure.frb.pvt/-/media/frbp/assets/institutional/speeches/harker/2024/240206-rowan-speech.pdf,fedpsp:97729
The homeownership experience of households in bankruptcy,"Li, Wenli, Carroll, Sarah W.",N/A,"This paper provides the first in-depth analysis of the homeownership experience of households in bankruptcy. The authors consider households who are homeowners at the time of filing. These households are typically seriously delinquent on their mortgages at the time of filing. The authors measure how often they end up losing their houses in foreclosure, the time between bankruptcy filing and foreclosure sale, and the foreclosure sale price. In particular, they follow homeowners who filed for chapter 13 bankruptcy between 2001 and 2002 in New Castle County, Delaware, through October 2007. They present three main findings. First, close to 30 percent of the filers lost their houses in foreclosure despite filing for bankruptcy. The rate rose to over 40 percent for those who were 12 months or more behind on their mortgage payment, about the same fraction as among those who entered into foreclosure directly. Second, filing for bankruptcy allowed those who eventually lost their houses to foreclosure to remain in their houses for, on average, an additional year. Third, although the average final sale price exceeded borrowers? own estimates at the time of filing, the majority of the lenders suffered losses. These findings are pertinent to the recent debate over the bankruptcy code on mortgage modification. Finally, the paper also reports circumstances related to the loan, borrower, and lender that make it more or less likely that a certain result will take place.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/2008/wp08-14.pdf,fedpwp:3639:original

Cointegration and a test of the quantity theory of money,"Mehra, Yash P.",N/A,"The main implication of the Quantity Theory of Money is that long-run movements in the price level are determined primarily by long-run movements in the excess of money over real output. This implication is related to the concept of cointegration discussed in Granger (1986), which states cointegrated multiple time series share common long-run movements. It is shown that the general price level is cointegrated with money, real output, and the nominal rate of interest. These economic variables enter a price equation based on the Equation of Exchange. Furthermore, the appearance of this cointegration in the data seems consistent with the presence of Granger-causality from money and real output to the price level. It is also shown that an inflation equation that incorporates the above stated implication of the Quantity Theory of Money predicts quite well the actual behavior of inflation during the past decade or so.

Unemployment Insurance during a Pandemic,"Xie, Zoe, Nie, Jun",N/A,"The CARES Act implemented in response to the COVID-19 crisis dramatically increased the generosity of unemployment insurance (UI) benefits, triggering concerns about substantial effects on unemployment. This paper combines a labor market search-matching model with the SIR-type infection dynamics to study the effects of the CARES Act UI on both unemployment and infection. More generous UI policies create work disincentives and lead to higher unemployment but also reduce infection and save lives. Economic shutdown policies further amplify these effects of UI policies. Quantitatively, the CARES UI policies raise unemployment by an average of 3.7 percentage points over April to December 2020, but also reduce cumulative death by 4.7 percent. Eligibility expansion and the extra $600 increase in benefit level account for over 90 percent of the total effects, while the 13-week benefit duration extension plays a much smaller role. Overall, UI policies improve the welfare of workers and reduce the welfare of non-workers, both young and old.",https://kansascityfed.org/documents/5633/rwp20_07_UnemploymentInsuranceDuringAPandemic.pdf,fedkrw:88579:original

Bullard Discusses Policy Rate Needed to Lower Inflation with Bloomberg TV,"Bullard, James B.",N/A,"St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard discussed the policy rate needed to get inflation down during an Oct. 19 interview on Bloomberg TV. He gave the interview at the St. Louis Fed ahead of the annual Homer Jones Memorial Lecture.

In the September Summary of Economic Projections, the Federal Open Market Committee seemed to be coalescing around further rate increases at upcoming meetings, even by the end of the year, Bullard said. He noted that most of that has been priced into markets. He said he would anticipate that’s having an impact, which is good news for trying to get inflation down.

“But we’ll have to follow through on that in the subsequent meetings this year and get the policy rate up to a level where we can put meaningful downward pressure on inflation,” Bullard said. “I think that’s the main goal immediately ahead of us at the committee.”

Bullard said that since inflation has continued to surprise to the upside, the rate he had calculated in May as the minimal policy rate level needed to put downward pressure on inflation would be higher now, at 4.5% or 4.75%, closer to FOMC “dot plot” projections.

There’s a possibility of a good dynamic in 2023, Bullard said. “I think if inflation does start to decline meaningfully, we can stay where we are at this higher level of the policy rate that meets the committee’s criteria,” he said. “And at that point, we could watch inflation fall and get back to 2%.”

Bullard also spoke about the Fed’s balance sheet runoff, the labor market and other economic indicators, including GDP.",https://www.stlouisfed.org/from-the-president/video-appearances/2022/bullard-policy-rate-needed-to-lower-inflation-bloomberg-tv,fedlps:94969

"Labor Supply Shocks, Labor Force Entry, and Monetary Policy","Kurozumi, Takushi, Van Zandweghe, Willem",N/A,"Should monetary policy offset the effects of labor supply shocks on inflation and the output gap? Canonical New Keynesian models answer yes. Motivated by weak labor force participation during the pandemic, we reexamine the question by introducing labor force entry and exit in an otherwise canonical model with sticky prices and wages. The entry decision generates an employment channel of monetary policy, and a labor supply shock to the value of nonparticipation in the labor market induces a policy trade-off between stabilization of the employment gap and wage growth. For an adverse labor supply shock, optimal policy dampens the decline in employment to rein in wage growth, which entails a period of higher inflation and a positive output gap. A welfare analysis of policy rules shows that monetary policy should not lean against the employment gap.",https://doi.org/10.26509/frbc-wp-202217,fedcwq:94266:original
Dominant-Currency Pricing and the Global Output Spillovers from U.S. Dollar Appreciation,"Georgiadis, Georgios, Schumann, Ben",N/A,"Different export-pricing currency paradigms have different implications for a host of issues that are critical for policymakers such as business cycle co-movement, optimal monetary policy, optimum currency areas and international monetary policy coordination. Unfortunately, the literature has not reached a consensus on which pricing paradigm best describes the data. Against this background, we test for the empirical relevance of dominant-currency pricing (DCP). Specifically, we first set up a structural three-country New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model which nests DCP, producer-currency pricing (PCP) and local-currency pricing (LCP). In the model, under DCP the output spillovers from shocks that appreciate the U.S. dollar multilaterally decline with an economy's export-import U.S. dollar pricing share differential, i.e., the difference between the share of an economy's exports and imports that are priced in the dominant currency. Underlying this prediction is a change in an economy's net exports in response to multilateral changes in the U.S. dollar exchange rate that arises because of differences in the extent to which exports and imports are priced in the dominant currency. We then confront this prediction of DCP with the data in a sample of up to 46 advanced and emerging-market economies for the time period from 1995 to 2018. Specifically, controlling for other cross-border transmission channels, we document that consistent with the prediction from DCP the output spillovers from U.S. dollar appreciation correlate negatively with recipient economies' export-import U.S. dollar invoicing share differentials. We document that these findings are robust to considering U.S. demand, U.S. monetary policy and exogenous exchange rate shocks as a trigger of U.S. dollar appreciation, as well as to accounting for the role of commodity trade in U.S. dollar invoicing.",https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/institute/wpapers/2019/0368.pdf,feddgw:14483:original

Heterogeneous bank lending responses to monetary policy: new evidence from a real-time identification,"Bowdler, Christopher, Bluedorn, John C., Koch, Christoffer",N/A,"We present new evidence on how heterogeneity in banks interacts with monetary policy changes to impact bank lending, at both the bank and U.S. state levels. Using an exogenous policy measure identified from narratives on FOMC intentions and real-time economic forecasts, we find much stronger dynamic effects and greater heterogeneity in U.S. bank lending responses than that found in previous research based on realized federal funds rate changes. Our findings suggest that studies using realized monetary policy changes confound monetary policy?s effects with those of changes in expected macrofundamentals. In fact, estimates from identified monetary policy changes lead to a reversal of U.S. states? ranking by credit?s sensitivity to policy.

We find that the removal of subsidies would reduce the world price of oil by six percent. The removal of subsidies is unambiguously welfare enhancing for the oil-importing countries.

Small business lending by commercial banks in Colorado : 1994 to 1996,"Spong, Kenneth, Phillips, Ronnie J., Sullivan, Richard J., Johnson, Richard L.",N/A,"The structure of Colorado's banking industry has recently undergone significant change and, therefore, provides a good case study with which to gauge the impact of consolidation on sources of loans and access to credit for small business. We find that between 1994 and 1996, lending to small businesses in Colorado by small to medium size banking organizations grew much faster than lending by large organizations. This lending pattern was similar across in-state and out-of-state banking organizations. Thus, the difference is largely driven by size rather than by the location of the organization's headquarters. Some large banking organizations lost market share, but others were aggressive lenders to small business. As a whole, large banking organizations still provided close to 40 percent of small business loans made by banks in 1996. ; Small business borrowers faced a shift in the source of bank finance, but there was a large overall increase in loans, and so it appears that their financing needs were adequately met. The large increase in small business lending by small and medium banking organizations is a particularly striking example of responding to the opportunities created by consolidation. In the future, however, large banks may reclaim market share as they expand new and lower cost methods of small business lending.",http://www.kansascityfed.org/PUBLICAT/FIP/prs98-2.pdf,fedkfi:33554

Analyzing a proposal to ban state tax breaks to businesses,"Holmes, Thomas J.",N/A,"This article asks whether or not the overall welfare of U.S. residents would be greater if U.S. federal law prohibited state governments from offering tax breaks to particular businesses. The answer of a formal model is yes, making such tax breaks illegal could increase a summary measure of total welfare in the economy. According to the model, the policy could increase welfare because it would increase the tax revenue collected from capital agents, and that revenue could finance an increase in spending on public goods. The policy would also spread the tax burden more evenly in the economy and so reduce the deadweight loss of taxation per dollar collected. In addition, the policy would lead to a more efficient pattern of industry locations in the economy.",http://minneapolisfed.org/research/qr/qr1922.html,fedmqr:41528
Vector autoregression evidence on monetarism: another look at the robustness debate,"Todd, Richard M.",N/A,"This paper is a case study of the use of vector autoregression (VAR) models to test economic theories. It focuses on the work of Christopher A. Sims, who in 1980 found that relationships in economic data generated by a small VAR model were inconsistent with those implied by a simple form of monetarist theory. The paper describes the work of researchers who criticized Sims' results as not robust and Sims' response to these critics. The paper reexamines all of this work by estimating hundreds of variations of Sims' model. The paper concludes that both Sims and his critics are right: Sims' conclusion about monetarism is robust, but some of his other statistical results are not. In general, the paper concludes that VAR models can be used to test theories, but that any relationships they uncover in the data must be carefully checked for robustness.",http://minneapolisfed.org/research/qr/qr1422.html,fedmqr:41651

The potential welfare gains are in part evaluated relative to a benchmark equilibrium of perfect, costless coordination; in practice, since agents will still have incentives to deviate from the benchmark equilibrium, coordination is likely to require enforcement. We consider an alternative benchmark equilibrium in which coordination is enforced by punishing deviators. This is formally equivalent to modeling agents as a cartel playing a punishment game. We show that this new benchmark implies that the welfare losses from coordination failure are smaller. Moreover, at the new benchmark equilibrium, prices are upwards-flexible but downwards-sticky. These last results suggest that the dynamic behavior of sticky-price models may more generally depend on the kind of imperfect competition assumed.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2003/200330/200330abs.html,fedgfe:34498:original

I find that the optimal policy that balances these motives typically still exhibits gradualism, i.e., is less aggressive than a policy that disregards parameter uncertainty. Exceptions occur when uncertainty is very high and inflation close to target.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/1998/199822/199822abs.html,fedgfe:35543:original
State Mandated Financial Education and the Credit Behavior of Young Adults,"Collins, J. Michael, Urban, Carly, Brown, Alexandra, Schmeiser, Maximilian D.",N/A,"In the U.S., a number of states have mandated personal finance classes in public school curricula to address perceived deficiencies in financial decision-making competency. Despite the growth of financial and economic education provided in public schools, little is known about the effect of these programs on the credit behaviors of young adults. Using a panel of credit report data, we examine young adults in three states where personal financial education mandates were implemented in 2007: Georgia, Idaho, and Texas. We compare the credit scores and delinquency rates of young adults in each of these states pre- and post-implementation of the education to those of students in a synthetic control state and then bordering states without financial education. We find that young people who are in school after the implementation of a financial education requirement have higher relative credit scores and lower relative delinquency rates than those in control states.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2014/201468/201468pap.pdf,fedgfe:35586:original

Cointegration tests in the presence of structural breaks,"Campos, Julia, Hendry, David F., Ericsson, Neil R.",N/A,"Structural breaks in stationary time series can induce apparent unit roots in those series. Thus, using recently developed recursive Monte Carlo techniques, this paper investigates the properties of several cointegration tests when the marginal process of one of the variables in the cointegrating relationship is stationary with a structural break. The break has little effect on the tests' size. However, tests based on estimated error correction models generally are more powerful than Engle and Granger's two-step procedure employing the Dickey-Fuller unit root test. Discrepancies in power arise when the data generation process does not have a common factor.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/1993/440/default.htm,fedgif:36801:original

We model the interaction of these truisms, and show the implications for global specialization and trade: products where timely delivery is important will be produced near the source of final demand, where wages will be higher as a result. In the model, timely delivery is important because it allows retailers to respond to fluctuating final demand without holding costly inventories, and timely delivery is only possible from nearby locations. Using a unique dataset that allows us to measure the retail demand for timely delivery, we show that the sources of US apparel imports have shifted in the way predicted by the model, with products where timeliness matters increasingly imported from nearby countries.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2003/766/default.htm,fedgif:37543:original

Competing with asking prices,"Visschers, Ludo, Wolthoff, Ronald, Lester, Benjamin",N/A,"In many markets, sellers advertise their good with an asking price. This is a price at which the seller is willing to take his good off the market and trade immediately, though it is understood that a buyer can submit an offer below the asking price and that this offer may be accepted if the seller receives no better offers. Despite their prevalence in a variety of real world markets, asking prices have received little attention in the academic literature. We construct an environment with a few simple, realistic ingredients and demonstrate that using an asking price is optimal: it is the pricing mechanism that maximizes sellers? revenues and it implements the efficient outcome in equilibrium. We provide a complete characterization of this equilibrium and use it to explore the positive implications of this pricing mechanism for transaction prices and allocations.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/2013/wp13-7.pdf,fedpwp:4416:original

Using measures of expectations to identify the effects of a monetary policy shock,"Brunner, Allan D.",N/A,"This paper considers an alternative econometric approach to the VAR methodology for identifying and estimating the effects of monetary policy shocks. The alternative approach incorporates available measures of market participants' expectations of economic variables in order to calculate economic innovations to those variables. In general, expectations measures should provide important additional information relative to a standard VAR analysis, since market participants presumably use a much richer information set than that assumed in a typical VAR model. The resulting innovations are easily incorporated in a VAR-like framework. ; The empirical results are quite surprising. First, when expectations are incorporated, the variance of all innovations is reduced substantially. Second, innovations to the federal funds rate derived using the alternative approach are only somewhat correlated with their VAR counterparts, while innovations to other economic variables are essentially uncorrelated. Still, monetary policy shocks derived using both approaches are still somewhat correlated, however, since innovations to prices and economic activity explain only a small fraction of innovations to the federal funds rate. As a consequence, the impulse responses of economic variables to the two sets of monetary policy shocks have remarkably similar properties.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/1996/537/default.htm,fedgif:36702:original

In this paper, we utilize frequency-domain and VAR methods to distinguish among several competing explanations for this phenomenon: improvements in monetary policy, better business practices, and a fortuitous reduction in exogenous disturbances. We find that reduced innovation variances account for much of the decline in aggregate output volatility. Our results support the \""good-luck\"" hypothesis as the leading explanation for the decline in aggregate output volatility, although \""good-practices\"" and \""good-policy\"" are also contributing factors. Applying the same methods to consumer price inflation, we find that the post-1984 decline in inflation volatility can be attributed largely to improvements in monetary policy.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ifdp/2002/730/default.htm,fedgif:36949:original

We find that most of the public understands that uncertainty is inherent in official GDP numbers. But communicating uncertainty information improves understanding. It encourages the public not to take estimates at face-value, but does not decrease trust in the data. Quantitative tools to communicate data uncertainty - notably intervals, density strips, and bell curves - are especially beneficial.

Conducting monetary policy without government debt: the Fed's early years,"Wheelock, David C.",N/A,"The Federal Reserve implements its monetary policy by using open market operations in U.S. government securities to target the federal funds rate. A substantial decline in the stock of U.S. Treasury debt could interfere with the conduct of monetary policy, possibly forcing the Fed to rely more heavily on discount window lending or to conduct open market transactions in other types of securities. Either would cause the implementation of monetary policy to resemble the methods used by the Fed before World War II. This paper describes two things: (i) how the Fed implemented monetary policy before the war and (ii) the conflicts that arose within the Fed over the allocation of private-sector credit when discount window loans and Fed purchases of private securities were a substantial component of Federal Reserve credit. Those conflicts help explain the Fed?s failure to respond vigorously to the Great Depression. The experience suggests that a renewed reliance on the discount window or on open market operations in securities other than those issued by the U.S. Treasury could hamper the conduct of monetary policy if it leads to increased pressure on the Fed to affect the allocation of credit.",https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/review/02/05/1-14Wheelock.pdf,fedlrv:24631

A joint study by the Tax Policy Center and the New England Policy Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston uses the Representative Revenue System (RRS) and the Representative Expenditure System (RES) frameworks to quantify these disparities across states by comparing each state?s revenue capacity, revenue effort, and necessary expenditures to the average capacity, effort, and need in states across the country for fiscal year 2002. ; The fiscal capacity of a state is the state?s revenue capacity relative to its expenditure need. A state with low fiscal capacity has a relatively small revenue base, a relatively high need for expenditures, or?as is often the case?a combination of both. ; The New England and Mid-Atlantic states tend to have high revenue capacity and low expenditure needs compared to the national average. Thus, states in these two regions tend to have high fiscal capacity, or a relatively high capability to cover their expenditure needs using own resources. South Central states, on the other hand, have low fiscal capacity?that is, a low level of revenue-raising capacity given what it would cost to provide a standard set of public services to their citizens. ; Little relation exists between the amount of federal aid received by states and their fiscal capacity; federal money is not primarily distributed to offset differences in the ability to raise revenues or provide services. Given the current level of federal funds allocated to state and local governments, 91 percent of the gap between revenue capacity and expenditure need across the states could be covered if federal funds were reallocated.",http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/neppc/wp/2006/neppcwp0602.htm,fedbcw:20231:original

"Loanable funds, risk, and bank service output","Wang, J. Christina",N/A,"This paper develops a unified theory of bank operations that integrates theories of financial intermediation, asset pricing, and production. In a simple dynamic model, banks maximize the present value of future profits generated through three categories of qualitatively distinct functions: (1) resolving information asymmetry in order to make loans, (2) providing transaction services, and (3) financing loans with borrowed funds. Risk determines the rate of return on the funds and in turn the discount rate for future profits. But risk affects the quantity of bank services generated in the first two functions only to the extent that assets of different risk require different amounts of information processing. The model thus coherently accounts for portfolio risk in measuring bank service output. It then recognizes that only functions (1) and (2) create bank value added, whereas the borrowed funds are merely an intermediate input in the provision of bank services. Furthermore, the funds and the production function for value added are separable in a bank's optimization solution. This model can resolve some long-standing debates in the literature on bank production, such as distinguishing between the input and output roles of deposits. It also provides a theoretical basis for measuring banking output in the National Income Accounts. This banking model implies a new measure of bank output that imputes the implicitly priced services as the part of net interest income that is free of risk-related returns on loanable funds. The new measure differs significantly from the ones commonly used, suggesting a need to reexamine the conclusions of a large body of empirical literature.",http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp2003/wp034.htm,fedbwp:7272:original
"Gifts, down payments, and housing affordability","Mayer, Christopher J., Engelhardt, Gary V.",N/A,"Recent evidence shows that homeownership rates among young households have declined substantially since the mid 1980s. Although factors such as late household formation and the increasing user cost of housing are contributing factors, reduced affordability is also a concern. Aggregate data indicate that first-time buyers are relying more heavily on gifts from relatives and less on own savings in accumulating the down payment. ; This paper explores the role of gifts in helping first-time buyers purchase a home using data from two different sources: surveys of recent home buyers in 18 cities between 1988 and 1993, and 1990 Boston loan applicants. The evidence shows that financial constraints are important in explaining the increased reliance on gifts, with the receipt of a gift being negatively related to income and wealth, and positively related to the one-year rate of appreciation of house prices.

Monetary policy in a Markov-switching VECM: implications for the cost of disinflation and the price puzzle,"Owyang, Michael T., Francis, Neville",N/A,"Monetary policy VARs typically presume stability of the long-run outcomes. We introduce the possibility of switches in the long-run equilibrium in a cointegrated VAR by allowing both the covariance matrix and weighting matrix in the error-correction term to switch. We find that monetary policy alternates between sustaining long-run growth and disinflationary regimes. Allowing state changes can also help explain the price puzzle and justify the use of commodity prices as a corrective measure. Finally, we show that regime-switching has implications for disinflationary monetary policy and can explain the variety of sacrifice ratio estimates that exist in the literature.",https://s3.amazonaws.com/real.stlouisfed.org/wp/2003/2003-001.pdf,fedlwp:9738:original
Reorganization or Liquidation: Bankruptcy Choice and Firm Dynamics,"Corbae, Dean, D'Erasmo, Pablo",N/A,"In this paper, we ask how bankruptcy law affects the financial decisions of corporations and its implications for firm dynamics. According to current U.S. law, firms have two bankruptcy options: Chapter 7 liquidation and Chapter 11 reorganization. Using Compustat data, we first document capital structure and investment decisions of non-bankrupt, Chapter 11, and Chapter 7 firms. Using those data moments, we then estimate parameters of a general equilibrium firm dynamics model with endogenous entry and exit to include both bankruptcy options. Finally, we evaluate a bankruptcy policy change similar to one recommended by the American Bankruptcy Institute that amounts to a ""fresh start"" for bankrupt firms. We find that changes to the law can have sizable consequences for borrowing costs and capital structure which via selection affects productivity, as well as long run welfare.",https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp769.pdf,fedmwp:88447:original

Shadow bank monitoring,"Cetorelli, Nicola, Adrian, Tobias, Ashcraft, Adam B.",N/A,"We provide a framework for monitoring the shadow banking system. The shadow banking system consists of a web of specialized financial institutions that conduct credit, maturity, and liquidity transformation without direct, explicit access to public backstops. The lack of such access to sources of government liquidity and credit backstops makes shadow banks inherently fragile. Shadow banking activities are often intertwined with core regulated institutions such as bank holding companies, security brokers and dealers, and insurance companies. These interconnections of shadow banks with other financial institutions create sources of systemic risk for the broader financial system. We describe elements of monitoring risks in the shadow banking system, including recent efforts by the Financial Stability Board.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr638.html,fednsr:12906

"Housing, portfolio choice, and the macroeconomy","Silos, Pedro",N/A,"Much of the macroeconomics literature dealing with wealth distribution has become abstracted from modeling housing explicitly. This paper investigates the properties of the wealth distribution and the portfolio composition regarding housing and equity holdings and their relationship to macroeconomic shocks. To this end, I construct a business cycle model in which agents differ in age, income, and wealth and derive utility from housing services. The model is consistent with several facts such as the life-cycle pattern of housing-to-wealth ratios, the larger degree of concentration for nonhousing wealth, and the smaller weight of housing in richer households? portfolios as well as the larger housing-to-wealth ratios in recessions. In addition, the model delivers the familiar business-cycle moments regarding relative standard deviations and procyclicality of consumption, investment, and employment.",https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/wp/2005/wp0521.pdf,fedawp:13388:original
Empirical tests of two state-variable HJM models,"Ritchken, Peter H., Bliss, Robert R.",N/A,"Models for pricing interest rate claims, developed under the Heath-Jarrow-Morton paradigm, differ according to the volatility structure imposed on forward rates. For most general HJM structures the resultant path dependence creates implementation problems. Ritchken and Sankarasubramanian have recently identified necessary and sufficient conditions on the class of volatility structures of forward rates that enable the term structure dynamics to be captured by a finite set of state variables. The class is quite rich. The instantaneous spot rate volatility may be quite general, but the model curtails the structure of forward rate volatilities relative to this spot rate volatility. This paper provides empirical tests for this class of volatility structures. Unlike other studies, the volatility structure is examined over the a broad section of maturities in the yield curve. Using Treasury data over the period 1982-1994, we find support for this class. Furthermore, unlike other studies, no evidence of a \""volatility\"" hump is identified.",https://www.atlantafed.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/wp/1995/wp9513.pdf,fedawp:13991:original

We present one that is enhanced to allow individuals to alter their behavior in response to the virus.

We find that when left to their own devices, individuals do curb their social activity in the face of risk, but not as much as a government planner would. The planner fully internalizes the effect of all individuals’ actions on others in society, while individuals do not.

Unequal Climate Policy in an Unequal World,"Hur, Sewon, Carroll, Daniel R., Belfiori, Elisa",N/A,"We study climate policy in an economy with heterogeneous households, two types of goods (clean and dirty), and a climate externality from the dirty good. Using household expenditure and emissions data, we document that low-income households have higher emissions per dollar spent than high-income households, making a carbon tax regressive. We build a model that captures this fact and study climate policies that are neutral with respect to the income distribution. A central feature of these policies is that resource transfers across consumers are ruled out. We show that the constrained optimal carbon tax in a heterogeneous economy is heterogeneous: Higher-income households face a higher rate. Our main result shows that when the planner is limited to a uniform carbon tax, the tax follows the Pigouvian rule but is lower than the unconstrained carbon tax. Finally, we embed this model into a standard incomplete markets framework to quantify the policy effects on the economy, climate and welfare, and we find a Pareto-improving result. The climate policy is welfare-improving for every consumer.",https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/research/international/wpapers/2024/0427.pdf,feddgw:98565:original

"The effects of past entry, market consolidation, and expansion by incumbents on the probability of entry","Amel, Dean F., Adams, Robert M.",N/A,"The threat of entry is an important factor in the evaluation of the potential competitive effects of proposed mergers and acquisitions. In the evaluation of proposed bank mergers, a high probability of entry, or strong potential competition, is often found to mitigate the potential anticompetitive effect of a proposed horizontal merger. Because the probability of entry is not directly observed for each local market, variables such as per capita income, population growth and past entry are typically used to predict the probability of future entry. This study extends previous research on the determinants of entry into local banking markets. In addition to variables considered by past research, such as market demographic characteristics, branching deregulation and past merger activity, this study considers the effects on future entry of past entry and strategic barriers to entry, which are proxied by changes in incumbent branching, the presence of small incumbent firms and market concentration. The analysis uses data that allow a broader definition of entry than that used in most past research. In most of the previous studies, bank entry is defined as the creation of a new banking institution. We show that this definition is problematic and misses entry due to branch network extension by existing banks, which is substantial. Results of our analysis are consistent with past research where past research exists. In addition, we find significant negative relationships between strategic barriers to entry and entry. Assessment of the quantitative significance of the results, however, finds that very large changes in the explanatory variables are needed to cause substantial changes in the probability of entry into banking markets.",http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2007/200751/200751abs.html,fedgfe:34166:original

Transparency and Collateral : Central versus Bilateral Clearing,"Carli, Francesco, Carapella, Francesca, Antinolfi, Gaetano",N/A,"Bilateral financial contracts typically require an assessment of counterparty risk. Central clearing of these financial contracts allows market participants to mutualize their counterparty risk, but this insurance may weaken incentives to acquire and to reveal information about such risk. When considering this trade-off, participants would choose central clearing if information acquisition is incentive compatible. If it is not, they may prefer bilateral clearing, when this choice prevents strategic default while economizing on costly collateral. In either case, participants independently choose the efficient clearing arrangement. Consequently, central clearing can be socially inefficient under certain circumstances. These results stand in contrast to those in Achary and Bisin (2014), who find that central clearing is always the optimal clearing arrangement.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2018017pap.pdf,fedgfe:34416:original

The microstructure of the TIPS market,"Krishnan, Neel, Fleming, Michael J.",N/A,"The potential advantages from the introduction of Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) in 1997 have not been fully realized, mainly because TIPS are less liquid than nominal Treasury securities. The lack of liquidity is thought to adversely affect TIPS prices relative to prices of nominal securities, offsetting the benefits that come from TIPS having no inflation risk. Despite the importance of TIPS liquidity and the market?s large size, there is virtually no quantitative evidence on the securities? liquidity. This article sheds light on this phenomenon using novel tick data from the interdealer market. The authors identify several features of the TIPS market also present in the nominal securities market, but some unique features as well. As in the nominal market, there is a marked difference in trading activity between the most recently issued (?on-the-run?) and previously issued (?off-the-run?) securities, as trading drops sharply when securities go off the run. In contrast to the nominal market, there is little difference in bid-ask spreads or quoted depth between these securities, but there is a difference in the incidence of posted quotes. These results suggest that trading activity and quote incidence may be better cross-sectional measures of liquidity in the TIPS market than bid-ask spreads or quoted depth. Intraday patterns of trading activity are broadly similar in both markets, but TIPS activity peaks somewhat later, likely reflecting differences in the use and ownership of these securities. Announcement effects also differ between markets, with TIPS auction results and CPI releases eliciting particularly strong increases in trading activity, likely indicating these announcements? special importance to TIPS valuation.",https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/epr/12v18n1/1203flem.pdf,fednep:19798

The model behavior is governed by two New Keynesian Phillips Curves. If durable goods are sufficiently long-lived we obtain an intriguing variant of the well-known ?divine coincidence.? In our model, the output gap depends only on inflation in the durable goods sector. We then analyze the optimal Taylor rule for this economy. If the monetary authority wants to stabilize the aggregate output gap, it places much more emphasis on stabilizing durable goods inflation (relative to its share of value-added in the economy). In contrast, if the monetary authority values stabilizing aggregate inflation, then it is optimal to respond to sectoral inflation in direct proportion to their shares of economic activity. Our results flow from the inherently high interest elasticity of demand for durable goods. We use numerical methods to verify the robustness of our analytical results for a broader class of model parameterizations.",https://chicagofed.org/~/media/publications/working-papers/2016/wp2016-18-pdf.pdf,fedhwp:6728:original

Do Costly Internal Equity Injections Reveal Bank Expectations about Post-Crisis Real Outcomes?,"Sapriza, Horacio, Gupta, Arun",N/A,"We construct a novel signal of bank expectations utilizing confidential data and a regulatory constraint imposed on bank internal capital markets during the 2008 crisis that made internal equity injections to commercial bank subsidiaries difficult to reverse. When the US government initiated a $176 billion recapitalization program during the crisis, this constraint made it costly ex-ante for multi-bank holding companies (MBHC) to use these funds for the purpose of recapitalizing subsidiaries against future anticipated losses; in contrast, lending the funds to subsidiaries was exempt from the constraint and thus carried an option value for future reallocations across sibling subsidiaries. Several findings emerge. First, we show that MBHCs treated internal equity injections as a scarce resource when emergency funds arrived, whereas single-bank holding companies did not because the constraint was not costly for them. Second, we find that excess internal equity injections by MBHCs form a signal of their expectations for post-crisis subsidiary outlook—i.e., future profitability, supervisory ratings, and credit originations. Third, the geographical aggregation of these individual bank signals predicts the long-run real effects of the 2008 crisis on small businesses across US states—i.e., post-crisis growth in small business revenues, employment, establishments, payroll, and wages. Our study provides a more direct test of ""banks as efficient information producers"" (e.g., Diamond (1984), Fama (1985)), and is the first to show that credible signals of this bank knowledge can be extracted from the internal capital markets, allowing regulators to forecast in real time a geographical rank-order for post-crisis real outcomes at small firms. This new policy tool can be seen as a potential side benefit of government-sponsored bank recapitalization programs, of which there have been 33 in the past 40 years worldwide.",https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/RichmondFedOrg/publications/research/working_papers/2023/wp23-03.pdf,fedrwp:95579:original
"Report to the Congress on Government-Administered, General-Use Prepaid Cards, July 2012",Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (U.S.),N/A,"Pursuant to section 1075 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which amends the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), the Board is required to report annually to the Congress on the prevalence of use of general-use prepaid cards (prepaid cards) in federal, state, and local government-administered payment programs and on the interchange transaction fees and card-holder fees charged with respect to the use of such prepaid cards. The Board distributed a survey to 15 depository institutions (issuers) and another survey to 158 federal, state, and local government offices (government offices) representing more than 200 programs to gather data for calendar year 2011. Government offices reported prevalence-of-use data for 158 federal, state, and local payment programs that disbursed more than $149 billion in 2011. Of these funds, 67 percent was disbursed through prepaid cards. This percentage is largely attributable to one large program’s exclusive use of prepaid cards to distribute funds. The Board was not able to calculate the prevalence of use of prepaid cards in 2010 because of the limited data provided by government offices. Issuers provided interchange fee data for 118 programs. The average 2011 interchange fee per transaction in these programs was 33 cents, or 1.1 percent of the average transaction value. The average interchange fee increased 3 cents from 2010. Average transaction size, however, also increased in value from 2010, so the average interchange fee as a percentage of average transaction value remained essentially unchanged from 2010. Issuers also provided information on fees that issuers pay to third parties for withdrawals from automated teller machines (ATM fees) and for over-the-counter transactions at banks (OTC fees). Issuers submitted data on ATM fees paid by issuers for 108 programs and OTC fees for 103 programs. The average per transaction ATM fee paid by issuers to third-party ATM operators decreased from 60 cents in 2010 to 52 cents in 2011. The average per transaction OTC fee paid by issuers to third-party banks was $2.03. The Board did not collect information regarding OTC fees in 2010. n addition, issuers provided information on fees-including ATM fees, overdraft fees, and account servicing fees, among others-that they assessed to cardholders. The average cardholder paid $2.90 in fees per card, or approximately 0.1 percent of the average total amount disbursed through prepaid cards. As with prevalence-of-use data, the average cardholder fees per card generally is attributable to one large program, which does not assess any fees to cardholders.

Seventh District Year in Review for 2024: Economic Growth Slowed to Near Average,"Walstrum, Thomas, Kepner, Elizabeth",N/A,"In 2024, economic growth slowed for both the United States and the Seventh Federal Reserve District, with growth rates having come in close to their respective ten-year averages.1 District employment continued to grow more slowly than national employment overall, and this was partly due to slower growth rates for the District in the education and health services sector and the manufacturing sector. One bright spot for District employment was the public sector: Employment in the public sector grew faster than in the private sector, making up for several years of relatively slow job gains during the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. For 2025, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants project U.S. growth will continue to slow, but not by much.",https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/chicago-fed-insights/2025/seventh-district-year-in-review-2024?utm_campaign=chicago_fed_insights&utm_medium=email&utm_source=chicagofed,h00003:99673

The Impact of the Age Distribution on Unemployment: Evidence from US States,"Foote, Christopher L., Fallick, Bruce",N/A,"Economists have studied the potential effects of shifts in the age distribution on the unemployment rate for more than 50 years. Most of this analysis uses a “shift-share” method, which assumes that the demographic structure has no indirect effects on age-specific unemployment rates. This paper uses state-level data to revisit the influence of the age distribution on unemployment in the United States. We examine demographic effects across the entire age distribution rather than just the youth share of the population—the focus of most previous work—and extend the date range of analysis beyond that which was available for previous research. We find that shifts in the age distribution move the unemployment rate in the direction that a mechanical shift-share model would predict. But these effects are larger than the mechanical model would generate, indicating the presence of amplifying indirect effects of the age distribution on unemployment.",https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2022/the-impact-of-the-age-distribution-on-unemployment-evidence-from-us-states.aspx,fedbwp:95257:original

Pareto Improving Fiscal and Monetary Policies: Samuelson in the New Keynesian Model,"Amador, Manuel, Arellano, Cristina, Aguiar, Mark",N/A,"This paper explores the positive and normative consequences of government bond issuances in a New Keynesian model with heterogeneous agents, focusing on how the stock of government bonds affects the cross-sectional allocation of resources in the spirit of Samuelson (1958). We characterize the Pareto optimal levels of government bonds and the associated monetary policy adjustments that should accompany Pareto-improving bond issuances. The paper introduces a simple phase diagram to analyze the global equilibrium dynamics of inflation, interest rates, and labor earnings in response to changes in the stock of government debt. The framework also provides a tractable tool to explore the use of fiscal policy to escape the Effective Lower Bound (ELB) on nominal interest rates and the resolution of the “forward guidance puzzle.” A common theme throughout is that following the monetary policy guidance from the standard Ricardian framework leads to excess fluctuations in income and inflation.",https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/sr/sr646.pdf,fedmsr:96368

The effect of Medicaid eligibility expansions on births,"Zavodny, Madeline, Bitler, Marianne P.",N/A,"In an effort to increase the use of prenatal care by pregnant women and the utilization of medical care by children, eligibility for Medicaid was expanded dramatically for pregnant women and children during the 1980s and early 1990s. By lowering the costs of prenatal care, delivery, and child health care for some individuals, Medicaid expansions may prompt some women to give birth who otherwise would not have children or lead some women to have more children than they otherwise would have. This study uses natality data from 1983 to 1996 to examine the relationship between a state's eligibility threshold for Medicaid and birth rates among various groups. The results suggest that expansions have significant and sizable effects on births. A 10 percentage point increase in the eligibility threshold is associated with a 1.4 percent increase in the birth rate among nonblack women and a 1.0 percent increase among black women. Between 1983 and 1996, the expansions appear to have led to an average increase in the birth rate of about 10 percent.",https://www.frbatlanta.org/-/media/documents/research/publications/wp/2000/wp0004.pdf,fedawp:13427:original

Do capital markets predict problems in large commercial banks?,"Cross, Stephen, Simons, Katerina",N/A,"In the present climate of intense debate over deposit insurance reform, the nature and limits of market discipline become especially important. The widely accepted argument for greater reliance on market discipline is that it will restrain managerial risk-taking and reduce potential losses to the deposit insurance fund. Opponents of this view favor the traditional reliance on supervision by the bank regulatory agencies as the primary method to maintain the safety and soundness of the banking system and the integrity of the deposit insurance fund. ; This article attempts to shed some empirical light on the issue by studying the effectiveness of market discipline as it is exercised by bank stockholders. Residual analysis is used to test whether the market anticipates the banks downgrade to a problem bank status. The results show that shareholder returns fail to anticipate bank downgrades by examiners. These results cast serious doubt on the supposed advantages investors, and particularly uninsured depositors, would have over bank regulators in restraining risk-taking by banks and in monitoring their management.",http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/neer/neer1991/neer391d.pdf,fedbne:41146

U.S. Housing as a Global Safe Asset: Evidence from China Shocks,"Converse, Nathan, Barcelona, William, Wong, Anna",N/A,"This paper demonstrates that the measured stock of China's holding of U.S. assets could be much higher than indicated by the U.S. net international investment position data due to unrecorded historical Chinese inflows into an increasingly popular global safe haven asset: U.S. residential real estate. We first use aggregate capital flows data to show that the increase in unrecorded capital inflows in the U.S. balance of payment accounts over the past decade is mainly linked to inflows from China into U.S. housing markets. Then, using a unique web traffic dataset that provides a direct measure of Chinese demand for U.S. housing at the zip code level, we estimate via a difference-in-difference matching framework that house prices in major U.S. cities that are highly exposed to demand from China have on average grown 7 percentage points faster than similar neighborhoods with low exposure over the period 2010-2016. These average excess price growth gaps co-move closely with macro-level measures of U.S. capital inflows from China, and tend to widen following periods of economic stress in China, suggesting that Chinese households view U.S. housing as a safe haven asset.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/files/ifdp1332.pdf,fedgif:93346:original

The potentially disadvantaged bank has the option of directly presenting checks to the first bank. The authors find that if the retail banking market is highly competitive, the first bank will not engage in such practices, but if the retail banking market is imperfectly competitive, it will find it advantageous to restrict access to its facilities. Lower costs of direct presentment can reduce (but not eliminate) the range over which these practices are employed. The practice of delayed presentment can either reduce or increase welfare, again depending on the degree of competition in the market. The model suggests that, were the Federal Reserve System to exit the business of check processing, practices such as delayed presentment would b e more prevalent.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/1997/wp97-16.pdf,fedpwp:4274:original

According to the permanent income hypothesis, a low personal saving rate should predict rising future income (Campbell, 1987). However, the U.S. personal saving rate is initially poorly measured and has been repeatedly revised upward in benchmark revisions. The authors use both conventional and real-time estimates of the personal saving rate in vector autoregressions to forecast real disposable income; using the level of the personal saving rate in real time would have almost invariably made forecasts worse, but first differences of the personal saving rate are predictive. They also test the lay hypothesis that a low personal saving rate has implications for consumption growth and find no evidence of forecasting ability.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/2007/wp07-8.pdf,fedpwp:4396:original

This substitution holds within ZIP codes, properties, and borrower types. Furthermore, the two groups exhibit similar delinquency rates. These findings suggest credit expanded predominantly through the increase in asset values rather than a relaxation of CLTV constraints, which supports models of the collateral channel or broad changes in house price expectations.",https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/2020/wp20-40.pdf,fedpwp:88847:original

The Persistent Employment Effects of the 2006-09 U.S. Housing Wealth Collapse,"Bhattarai, Saroj, Schwartzman, Felipe, Yang, Choongryul",N/A,"We show that the housing wealth collapse of 2006-09 had a persistent impact on employment across counties in the U.S. In particular, localities that had a larger loss in housing net worth during that period had more depressed employment as late as 2016, without a commensurate population response. The use of IV's and controls to identify the causal impact of the wealth shock amplifies those results, leading to an estimate that a 10 percent change in housing net worth between 2006 and 2009 causes a 4.5 percent decline in local employment by 2016, as compared with a 2006 baseline. We do not find a long-term causal impact of the shock on wages. Sectoral results indicate, however, that the results are unlikely to be purely a result of persistently low demand, since, contrary to the short-run effects, the effect over the longer horizon is less concentrated in the non-tradables sectors and is instead more prominent in the high-skilled services sector.",https://www.richmondfed.org/-/media/richmondfedorg/publications/research/working_papers/2019/wp19-07.pdf,fedrwp:18493:original

The public needs to be confident that the system will be: available whenever the customer needs it; efficient at routing and settling payments; resilient against cyberattacks and fraudulent actors; and reliable without the public having to know the intricacies of the infrastructure behind it. As the payment system evolves, the Fed, the industry, and end users will need to continue to collaborate to ensure that the modern payment system lives up to its promise of being efficient, safe, resilient, and available to all.

Location of headquarter growth during the 90s,"Klier, Thomas H.",N/A,"This paper examines the location of headquarter growth of large public companies during the 1990s. Headquarters continue to be attracted by large metropolitan areas. Yet, among that group they continue to disperse into the medium-sized centers. The model results suggest that headquarter growth is elastic with respect to population growth. In addition, average January temperature emerges as a predictor of headquarter growth. Furthermore, the paper identifies 6 different categories of gross flows underlying the net change of headquarters observed during the 90s. There is strong variation among the 50 largest metro areas in terms of the composition of these gross flows. On average, entry and exit represent over 2/3 of all gross flow activity. Including information on the composition of gross flows noticeably improves the formal model.",http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2002/wp2002-19.pdf,fedhwp:6389:original
The Effect of Fertility on Mothers’ Labor Supply over the Last Two Centuries,"Schulze, Karl, Dehejia, Rajeev, Pop-Eleches, Cristian, Samii, Cyrus, Jordan, Andrew",N/A,"This paper documents the evolving impact of childbearing on the work activity of mothers. Based on a compiled dataset of 441 censuses and surveys between 1787 and 2015, representing 103 countries and 48.4 million mothers, we document three main findings: (1) the effect of fertility on labor supply is small and typically indistinguishable from zero at low levels of development and economically large and negative at higher levels of development; (2) this negative gradient is remarkably consistent across histories of currently developed countries and contemporary cross-sections of countries; and (3) the results are strikingly robust to identification strategies, model specification, data construction, and rescaling. We explain our results within a standard labor-leisure model and attribute the negative labor supply gradient to changes in the sectoral and occupational structure of female jobs as countries develop.",https://www.chicagofed.org/~/media/publications/working-papers/2017/wp2017-14-pdf.pdf,fedhwp:6822:original
It's Good Weather for More Government: The Effect of Weather on Fiscal Policy,"de Souza, Gustavo",N/A,"I show that weather conditions on election day affect future fiscal policy. When it rains during state elections, there is an increase in the relative income of voters, which is followed by an increase in expenditure and debt. The increase in expenditure is directed towards a larger police and safety budget. This result is compatible with a model of complementarity between consumption and public goods. In the model, high-income voters support an increase in safety budget because they benefit more from it than low-income voters.",https://doi.org/10.21033/wp-2022-48,fedhwp:95078:original
The Labor Market Impact of Covid-19 on Asian Americans,"Qin, Suvy, de Mena, Chris, Zhang, Jing",N/A,"Asian Americans faced a disproportionately larger surge in unemployment rates than other racial and ethnic groups during the Covid-19 pandemic. While existing literature typically examines labor demand channels to explain this, we instead explore a labor supply channel. Our hypothesis is that Asian Americans are more cautious about Covid-19 infections and thus more selective about job opportunities, contributing to their higher unemployment rate than other groups. Analysis of cellphone data during the pandemic indicates that non-work mobility significantly decreased in areas with larger Asian populations, supporting our hypothesis.",https://www.chicagofed.org/-/media/publications/working-papers/2023/wp2023-10.pdf?sc_lang=en,fedhwp:95998:original
Labor Market Cooling Has Been Uneven Across Industries,"Pollard, Emily, Dilts Stedman, Karlye",N/A,"The U.S. labor market has cooled over the last two years but remains healthy overall. However, an industry-specific version of the KC Fed’s Labor Market Conditions Indicators (LMCI) suggests pockets of tightness and weakness have appeared in a few industries. Tightness appears to be limited to less labor-intensive industries, limiting upside risk to inflation. Weakness, on the other hand, has appeared in the interest-rate-sensitive information industry, which may be vulnerable to further labor market cooling.",https://www.kansascityfed.org/documents/10670/EconomicBulletin25DiltsStedmanPollard0131.pdf,fedkeb:99493

What caused the Great Moderation? : some cross-country evidence,"Summers, Peter M.",N/A,"Over the last 20 years or so, the volatility of aggregate economic activity has fallen dramatically in most of the industrialized world. The timing and nature of the decline vary across countries, but the phenomenon has been so widespread and persistent that it has earned the label: ?the Great Moderation.? A growing body of research has focused on the Great Moderation and its possible explanations, especially as it applies to the U.S. experience. The literature documents the international dimension of this volatility reduction, but so far little is known about the possible causes from a cross-country perspective. Summers shows why the Great Moderation has indeed been a common feature of much of the industrialized world. Specifically, he focuses on the reduction in the volatility of GDP growth that occurred in the G-7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and Australia. He uses international evidence to evaluate the merits of three likely explanations. He concludes that, from an international perspective, good luck in the form of smaller energy price shocks is not a compelling explanation for widespread moderation of GDP growth volatility. Rather, the Great Moderation is more likely due to better monetary policy outcomes and improved inventory management techniques.",https://www.kansascityfed.org/documents/1124/2005-What%20Caused%20The%20Great%20Moderation%3F%20Some%20Cross-Country%20Evidence.pdf,fedker:31534
Coming home to rural America: demographic shifts in the Tenth District,"Akers, Maria, Henderson, Jason",N/A,"Sweeping demographic shifts are challenging the growth of many rural communities in the Tenth District. The retirement of the baby boomers, coupled with the exodus of young adults, threatens to leave rural areas with a rapidly aging population and a shrinking local workforce. The strength of these demographic changes could hinder economic growth for many rural communities in the future. ; Rural communities in the district, however, are quietly enjoying another demographic shift?a return of middle-aged residents to rural places. This shift may be a promising sign for economic growth and wealth generation. Rural areas, of course, must continue to face the challenges of an aging population and the loss of young adults. But the in-migration of middle-aged residents and their families could raise a new question for economic development. Instead of simply trying to stem the tide of young adult out-migration, should rural areas focus more on the recent trend of middle-aged families coming home to rural America? ; Henderson and Akers discuss the economic implications of aging populations and migration patterns on rural Tenth District communities. They find that while rural communities in the Tenth District will struggle with aging populations and the loss of young adults, enhancing quality-of-life amenities appear to be a way for rural communities to benefit from the return of middle-aged families.",https://www.kansascityfed.org/documents/1112/2009-Coming%20Home%20to%20Rural%20America:%20Demographic%20Shifts%20in%20the%20Tenth%20District.pdf,fedker:31759
Meeting the challenges : community bankers' views,"Lemieux, Catharine",N/A,"Dramatic changes are occurring in our financial system and the pace of change is increasing. These changes provide opportunities for community bankers, but they also create new challenges. To explore how community banks will respond to these challenges, we asked Tenth District community bankers for their views on how their banks will be affected over the next five years. ; Our survey focused on four broad areas--bank and nonbank competition, operational matters, ownership and human resource concerns, and banking regulation's impact. In the first area, survey respondents expect to face strong competition from bank and nonbank firms, with some nonbank firms being viewed as some of their strongest competitors. To answer this competition, District community bankers plan some operational changes, e.g., emphasizing service charges and fee income and expanding investment services. However, most will continue to rely on traditional loan and deposit products. In the area of ownership and human resources, many respondents do not see ownership and management changing at their banks in the next five years. They also do not anticipate difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified nonofficial staff. However, a majority do expect problems in attracting and retaining qualified directors. Regarding regulation, many bankers indicate they have made operational changes to accommodate the current regulatory environment. In addition, many note that regulatory compliance costs are growing and hurting profitability. They see increased regulation making it harder for them to compete against less regulated nonbank firms and ultimately hampering their ability to survive.",,fedkfi:33549
